Welcome to CluedIn’s terms of service. These terms set out the legal framework for using our platform and related services.

## Standard CluedIn contract
The [standard CluedIn contract](https://www.cluedin.com/terms-and-conditions) defines the terms under which you use CluedIn’s products and services. It explains what you can expect from CluedIn and what CluedIn expects from you as a customer. The contract covers key topics such as licensing, confidentiality, compliance, and more.

## Service level agreement (SLA)

- CluedIn provides a dedicated service level agreement (SLA) for our [SaaS customers](/get-cluedin#onboarding-path-for-cluedin-saas), which specifies our commitments to service availability, uptime, and support response times.

- To maintain full SLA coverage, CluedIn operations team must have direct access to your cluster environment. This means our engineers can securely connect to the cluster without waiting for approvals or have a jump box available. If direct access is unavailable, SLA response and resolution times may be temporarily paused until access is restored.
