Welcome to CluedIn’s terms of service. These terms set out the legal framework for using our platform and related services, including the standard CluedIn contract and service-level agreements (SLAs).

## Standard CluedIn contract
The [standard CluedIn contract](https://www.cluedin.com/terms-and-conditions) defines the terms under which you use CluedIn’s products and services. It explains what you can expect from CluedIn and what CluedIn expects from you as a customer. The contract covers key topics such as licensing, confidentiality, compliance, and more.

## SaaS

### SaaS SLA

For CluedIn [SaaS customers](/get-cluedin#onboarding-path-for-cluedin-saas), CluedIn provides a dedicated service level agreement (SLA), which specifies our commitments to service availability, uptime, and support response times.

## PaaS

{:.important}
For CluedIn [PaaS customers](/get-cluedin#onboarding-path-for-cluedin-paas), maintaining full SLA coverage requires that the CluedIn operations team has direct access to your cluster environment. This means our engineers can securely connect to the cluster without waiting for approvals, or have a jump box available. If direct access is unavailable, SLA response and resolution times may be temporarily paused until access is restored.
