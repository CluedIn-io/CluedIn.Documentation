Searching the data catalog is a valuable tool for streamlining data discovery. This article provides information on how to make the process of finding metadata faster and more efficient by using filters.

**Vocabularies**

By default, the **All Vocabularies** page displays only used vocabularies. These are the vocabularies that contain the vocabulary keys used in golden records.

You can use the search box to find the vocabulary you need. Enter either the full name or a partial name of the vocabulary and start the search. All vocabularies that match your input will be displayed on the page.

You can filter the vocabularies using the filter pane in the upper-right corner of the page. The following filters are available:

- Business domain – filters vocabularies based on their primary business domain. By default, all business domains are selected. To narrow down your search results, you can opt for a specific business domain.

- Integrations – filters vocabularies based on their source. By default, all integrations are selected. To narrow your search results, you can select an option to display vocabularies that are not associated with a specific source, or you can select a specific source.

- Usage – filters vocabularies based on their usage in golden records. By default, only used vocabularies are shown, and you have the option to display all, used, or unused vocabularies.

If the filtered results do not meet your requirements, you can reset the filters and try again.
