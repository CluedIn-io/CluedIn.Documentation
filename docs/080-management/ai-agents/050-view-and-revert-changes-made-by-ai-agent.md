1. To view the changes made to a specific record, select that record in the list.

1. On the golden record page, do one of the following:

    - Go to the **History** tab. Then, locate the record named **AI Agent Job Source** - _Agent name_ - _Job name_. For example, **AI Agent Job Source - Client Data Steward - Fix data quality issues**.

        Expand the record to view the list of changes made.

    - Go to the **Topology** tab. Then, locate the node that indicates the changes made by the AI agent. Such nodes are marked with the AI agent icon.

        Click the node to view the list of changes made.

        In the **Value** column, you can view the new property value that the record received after the AI agent made the changes. If you want to view the values both before and after the changes, use the **History** tab.
