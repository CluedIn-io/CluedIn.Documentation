Rules enable you to establish business logic for managing your records within CluedIn. In this section, you will learn how to automate data transformation, capture data quality issues, and determine operational values with the help of different types of rules.

A rule consists of a filter and one or more associated actions. Filter tells CluedIn what records should be affected by the rule's action. The following diagram shows the basic steps of creating a rule in CluedIn.
