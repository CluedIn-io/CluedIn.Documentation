- [Creating and managing workflows](/workflow/create-and-manage-workflows) – learn how to create a workflow for automating a specific approval process and how to find the details about the actions that triggered workflow runs.

- [Manage approval requests](/workflow/manage-approval-requests) – learn how to view, approve, or reject the approval requests.
