CluedIn makes doing business easy by giving you flexibility to adopt our platform at your own pace. We are offering 2 cloud models of CluedIn:

- **SaaS** (software as a service) – allows you to use CluedIn on a subscription basis. Instead of installing CluedIn in your own Azure IT infrastructure, you can access it in an isolated environment through a web browser. As a software provider, we are responsible for hosting, managing updates, and ensuring security.

- **PaaS** (platform as a service) – allows you to install and manage CluedIn in your own Azure IT infrastructure, thus ensuring that your data stays in your own environment. As a software provider, we are managing updates and ensuring security. However, hosting the platform is your responsibility, giving you flexibility and control over your infrastructure while benefiting from our managed services.

For more details about the difference between CluedIn installation options, see [Installation](/deployment).

**Where can I find information about pricing models?**

- To learn about our pay-as-you pricing model, see [Pricing](/deployment/pricing).

- To learn about our committed deal pricing model, book a meeting with our sales team representative [here](https://www.cluedin.com/discovery-call).

**Can I change my pricing model?**

Yes, you can change your pricing model from pay-as-you-go to committed deal and vice versa. However, a change from committed deal to pay-as-you-go is governed by the terms of the contract. If you decide to change the pricing model, contact our support team by email <a href="mailto:support@cluedin.com">support-ama@cluedin.com</a>.

**Can I move from SaaS to PaaS or vice versa?**

Yes, but there is a migration fee for this process. If you decide to change the cloud service model, contact our support team by email <a href="mailto:support@cluedin.com">support-ama@cluedin.com</a>.

## Onboarding path for CluedIn SaaS

By onboarding path, we mean the process of purchasing and installing CluedIn. After completing the onboarding steps, you'll get a link to your CluedIn instance and you can start using the system.

### CluedIn SaaS pay-as-you-go

This is the easiest and quickest way to start with CluedIn. You don't need an IT team to install and start using CluedIn.

**Who can start CluedIn SaaS pay-as-you-go onboarding?**

Depending on whether you have the authority to create a pay-as-you-go Azure account with your business credit card, there are two options:

- If yes, you and your team can drive the CluedIn project in your company on your own.

- If no, you need to meet several Azure requirements. Generally, you would need to find a person in your company who can make you a contributor for an Azure subscription where CluedIn will be stored.
