CluedIn makes doing business easy by giving you flexibility to adopt our platform at your own pace. We are offering 2 cloud models of CluedIn:

- **SaaS** (software as a service) - allows you to use CluedIn on a subscription basis through a cloud-hosted, shared environment. Instead of installing CluedIn in your own Azure IT infrastructure, you can access it via a web browser. As a software provider, we handle the hosting, updates, maintenance, and security of the platform.

  
- **Private SaaS** (software as a service) – allows you to use CluedIn on a private instance. Instead of installing CluedIn in your own Azure IT infrastructure, you can access it in an isolated environment through a web browser. As a software provider, we are responsible for hosting, managing updates, and ensuring security.

    For details about the available service levels and support options, see our <a href="../../assets/other/CluedIn SaaS SLA - 2025.pdf" download>CluedIn Private SaaS SLA</a>.

- **PaaS** (platform as a service) – allows you to install and manage CluedIn in your own Azure IT infrastructure, thus ensuring that your data stays in your own environment. As a software provider, we are managing updates and ensuring security. However, hosting the platform is your responsibility, giving you flexibility and control over your infrastructure while benefiting from our managed services.

For more details about the difference between CluedIn installation options, see [Installation](/deployment).

**Can I change my pricing model?**

Yes, you can change your pricing model from pay-as-you-go to committed deal and vice versa. However, a change from committed deal to pay-as-you-go is governed by the terms of the contract. If you decide to change the pricing model, contact our support team by email <a href="mailto:support@cluedin.com">support@cluedin.com</a>.

**Can I move from SaaS to PaaS or vice versa?**

Yes, but there is a migration fee for this process. If you decide to change the cloud service model, contact our support team by email <a href="mailto:support@cluedin.com">support@cluedin.com</a>.
