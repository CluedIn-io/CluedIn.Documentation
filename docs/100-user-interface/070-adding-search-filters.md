You might find that you will want to filter your search queries by very particular Vocabularies in the User Interface. For this, you will want to add custom search filters to CluedIn. You can do this from your search screen in which you can filter by a Vocabulary. As you type the value, you will see that CluedIn will start to auto-suggest what values you would like to find based of the values that are already in the platform. You can also search for values that don't exist, but this will typically result in 0 results.
