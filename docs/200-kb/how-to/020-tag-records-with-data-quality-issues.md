In this article, you will learn how to tag records with data quality issues using data part rules. We will use invalid email address as an example of a data quality issue.

To begin with, we have ingested, mapped, and processed a file containing contact data. Some records include invalid email addresses. Note that the email addresses in rows 1â€“3 violate common email address formatting rules.

To tag records with such data quality issues, [create](/management/rules/create-rule) a data part rule and add an action to tag records if the email value does not match the acceptable patten of a common regular expression (for example, `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$`). You can use the **Conditions** section of the action to specify the acceptable pattern for the vocabulary key value.

Next, save, activate and re-process the rule. To verify that the rule has been applied, go to search and use the **Tags** filter.

As a result, you will see all records where the email value is in the invalid format. Records with invalid email addresses contain the corresponding tag.

When the records with data quality issues are tagged, you can then [create](/preparation/clean/create-clean-project) a clean project to fix such issues. To do it, in the upper-right corner of the search results page, open the three-dot menu, and select **Clean**.
