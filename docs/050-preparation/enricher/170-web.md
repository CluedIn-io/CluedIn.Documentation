This article outlines how to configure the Web enricher. The purpose of this enricher is to provide information about companies through their websites (for example, description, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts, technologies list, and so on). More details can be found in [Properties from Web enricher](#properties-from-web-enricher).

The Web enricher supports any website provided in the **Website Vocab Key** field of the enricher configuration.

## Add Web enricher

The Web enricher uses the company website as an input for retrieving additional information about a golden record from the internet.

**To add the Web enricher**

1. On the navigation pane, go to **Preparation** > **Enrich**. Then, select **Add Enricher**.

1. On the **Choose Enricher** tab, select **Web**, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Test Connection** to make sure the enricher is properly configured, and then select **Add**.

    The Web enricher is added and has an active status. This means that it will enrich golden records based on the configuration details during processing or when you trigger external enrichment.

After the Web enricher is added, you can modify its details:

- **Settings** – add a user-friendly display name, select the description for data coming from the enricher, and define the source quality for determining the winning values.

- **Authentication** – modify the details you provided while configuring the enricher.
