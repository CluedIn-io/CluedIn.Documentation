This article outlines how to configure the CVR enricher. [CVR](https://datacvr.virk.dk/) is the official Danish register of information about businesses. The purpose of CVR enricher is to provide a wide range of information about companies registered in Denmark (for example, CVR numbers, addresses, business type, and so on). More details can be found in [Properties from CVR enricher](#properties-from-cvr-enricher).

To use the CVR enricher, you need to have a valid CVR account. Also, you need to generate the URL for your account, which should look similar to the following: `http://cvruser:password12345@distribution.virk.dk/cvr-permanent/_search`. Then, reach out to CluedIn support at [support@cluedin.com](mailto:support@cluedin.com) to set up the URL for the CVR enricher in your CluedIn instance.

The CVR enricher supports the following endpoint:

- `http://{username}:{password}@distribution.virk.dk/cvr-permanent/_search`, where `{username} and {password}` are the valid credentials for your CVR account.

## Add CVR enricher

The enricher requires at least one of the following attributes for searching the CVR register:

- **CVR Code** – if your golden records have CVR codes, you can enter the corresponding vocabulary key to configure the enricher. As a result, the enricher will use the CVR code to search the CVR register.

- **Organization Name**, **Country**, and **Website** – if your golden records do not have CVR codes, you can enter these three attributes to configure the enricher. As a result, the enricher will use the combination of organization name, country, and website to search the CVR register. However, there are some requirements for each attribute.

**Requirements for Organization Name**

- The organization name must be a valid company name (with Ltd, Pty, and so on).

- The organization name must contain at least one of the following values: **"dk"**, **"dk "**, **"denmark"**, **"danmark"**, **"dansk"**, **"æ"**, **"ø"**, **"å"**; or the postfix must contain one of the following values: **"A/S"**, **"AS"**, **"ApS"**, **"IVS"**, **"I/S"**, **"IS"**, **"K/S"**, **"KS"**, **"G/S"**, **"GS"**, **"P/S"**, **"PS"**, **"Enkeltmandsvirksomhed"**, **"Forening"**, **"Partsrederi"**, **"Selskab"**, **"virksomhed"**.

**Requirement for Country**

- The country must be either **"dk"**, **"denmark"**, or **"danmark"**. If the country does not meet this requirement, then the requirement for website must be met.

**Requirement for Website**

- The website's top-level domain must end with **".dk"** (for example, _abc.dk_).

**To add the CVR enricher**

1. On the navigation pane, go to **Preparation** > **Enrich**. Then, select **Add Enricher**.

1. On the **Configure** tab, provide the following details:

    - **Accepted Business Domain** – enter the business domain to define which golden records will be enriched.

    - **Organization Name Vocabulary Key** – enter the vocabulary key that contains company names that will be used for searching the CVR register.

    - **Organization Name Normalization** – turn on the toggle if you want to normalize company names that will be used for searching the CVR register. The normalization removes trailing backslashes (&#92;), slashes (/), and vertical bars; also, it changes the names to lowercase. The normalization does not affect company names in CluedIn.

    - **Match Past Organization Names** – turn on the toggle if you want to allow the enricher to accept data that matches the search text (organization name), even if the name of the latest data in the CVR register doesn't exactly match the search text. For example, Pfizer ApS is one of the old names of Pfizer A/S; by turning on the toggle, you can search for Pfizer ApS using the search text (Pfizer ApS).

    - **CVR Vocabulary Key** – enter the vocabulary key that contains company CVR codes that will be used for searching the CVR register.

1. Select **Test Connection** to make sure the enricher is properly configured, and then select **Add**.

    The CVR enricher is added and has an active status. This means that it will enrich golden records based on the configuration details during processing or when you trigger external enrichment.

After the CVR enricher is added, you can modify its details:

- **Settings** – add a user-friendly display name, select the description for data coming from the enricher, and define the source quality for determining the winning values.

- **Authentication** – modify the details you provided while configuring the enricher.
