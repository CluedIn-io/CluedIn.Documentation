A golden record is an accurate and consolidated representation of a data subject, such as an organization or an employee, derived from multiple sources. A golden record provides a 360-degree view of a data subject, facilitating a deeper understanding of its current state and the reasons behind it.

A golden record is created through a process of data integration, enrichment, cleaning, deduplication, and manual data entry. Each step in the process is registered as a separate element called a _record_ or a _data part_. The terms record and data part are used interchangeably. A golden record is usually made up of multiple records.

The purpose of creating a golden record is to provide a single source of truth, ensuring data consistency, improving data quality, and enabling better decision-making. A golden records serves as a reliable reference point that can be used by different systems, departments, or stakeholders within the organization.
