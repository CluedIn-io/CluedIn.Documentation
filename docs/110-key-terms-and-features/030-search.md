### Sort records

By default, the golden records on the search results page are sorted by relevance. This means that CluedIn prioritizes golden records that are most likely to match your search query closely. Sorting by relevance ensures that the most pertinent results are displayed at the top of the page, facilitating efficient data retrieval.

In addition to sorting by relevance, CluedIn provides two alternative sorting options:

- Sorting by new – choosing this option arranges golden records in descending order of their creation or modification date, with the most recently added or updated records appearing at the top.

- Sorting by old – choosing this option arranges golden records in ascending order of their creation or modification date, with the oldest records appearing at the top.

**To sort records**

- In the upper-right corner of the search results page, expand the sorting dropdown menu, and then select the needed sorting option.

    The new sorting is applied to the search results.

### Change page view

CluedIn provides two page view options:

- **Tile view** (a) – presents records in a visual grid-like format. In this view, records are arranged in rectangular tiles, each representing a specific record.

- **Tabular view** (b) – presents records in a structured table format. In this view, records are arranged in rows and columns, resembling a spreadsheet or database table.
