In this article, you will learn how to delete golden records. Please note that deleting golden records is permanent and irreversible, so carefully consider which golden records you want to delete.

You can delete a golden record in two places:

- [On the golden record page](#delete-one-golden-record) – use this option if you want to delete one golden record.

- [On the search results page](#delete-several-golden-records) – use this option if you want to delete several golden records at once.

**Important!** Deleting a golden record is different from [deleting data parts](/golden-records/delete-data-parts-from-golden-records) or [removing records from a data source](/integration/additional-operations-on-records/remove-records). When you remove records from a data source, all data parts originating from that source are removed from every golden record in which they are used. Deleting data parts from a golden record allows you to delete specific data parts originating from almost any source in a golden record. In contrast, deleting a golden record means that the entire record is permanently removed.

## Delete one golden record

If you no longer need a specific golden record, you can delete it on the golden record page.

**To delete a golden record**

1. Open the golden record that you want to delete.

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Delete**.

1. Review the details of the golden record that will be deleted, and then select **Next**.

1. Confirm that you want to delete the golden record by entering _DELETE_. Then, select **Confirm**.

If you no longer need a set of golden records, you can select those golden records on the search results page and delete them.

**To delete several golden records**
