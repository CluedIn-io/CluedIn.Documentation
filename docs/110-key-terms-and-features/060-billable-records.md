A billable record is a unique data part that forms a golden record. Not all data parts are considered billable records. The data parts that appeared from the following processes are not billable records:

- Enrichment
- Clean projects
- User input (editing properties manually)
- Shadow entities
- Any updates from the source record

Every time a golden record is processed, the count of billable records is calculated.

The following video illustrates the difference between billable records and golden records.
