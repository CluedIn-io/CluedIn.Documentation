---

CluedIn provides powerful REST and GraphQL APIs. To simplify programmatic interaction, we offer the [CluedIn Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/cluedin/) â€” a Python package that handles authentication, automation, data import and export, data transformation, and data exploration.

You can use CluedIn Python SDK in many environments, from your local laptop to cloud services like:

- [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/synapse-analytics)
- [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)
- [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)
- [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)
- [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

The above list is non-exhaustive. You can use CluedIn Python SDK in any environment where you can run Python code.

Some of the scenarios where CluedIn Python SDK will be helpful are:
- Querying data from your CluedIn instance.
- Exporting and saving the data to CSV, Parquet, Excel, JSON, or many other file formats.
- Reading and writing configuration of your CluedIn instance.
- Ingesting data in CluedIn.
- Automating repetitive actions to reduce manual work in UI.
