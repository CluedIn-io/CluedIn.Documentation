We have the following **assumptions** about the customers' Microsoft Azure setup:

- Customers own only one Purview resource.

- When ingesting data from ADF, the ADF pipeline should only do a one-to-one mapping from targeted file on Azure to API endpoint.

The following table lists the available Purview packages and versions.
