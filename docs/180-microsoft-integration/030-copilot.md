**Notes on CluedIn's integration with Azure OpenAI**

- CluedIn integrates with Azure OpenAI services solely to enable you to make requests and store responses through our platform.

- To interact with Azure OpenAI services via CluedIn's Rule Engine, AI mapping, or Copilot, you must decide where to host Azure OpenAI, including which tenants and locations to use. CluedIn does not provide a default Azure OpenAI token; you must configure CluedIn with your own Azure OpenAI token. Selection of Azure OpenAI services and models within your environment is entirely at your discretion.

- CluedIn transmits your prompts and the data contained within them to Azure OpenAI, giving you full control over the models and deployments used within your environment. Your prompts and results are also stored in CluedIn's SQL server to preserve your prompt history.

- CluedIn cannot comment on how Azure OpenAI manages or processes data internally. Data handling by Azure OpenAI is governed solely by the agreement established directly between you and Microsoft Azure.
