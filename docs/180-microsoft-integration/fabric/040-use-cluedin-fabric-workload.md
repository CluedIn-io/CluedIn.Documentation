CluedIn provides a native Microsoft Fabric Workload that can take data in your Fabric environment and clean it through the CluedIn Clean application.

You can have the processing of the cleaning happen in CluedIn, or, you can choose to run the processing in Fabric. 

**Install the Fabric Workload**

You can install the CluedIn Cleanse Workload by first asking support@cluedin.com to invite you to the Private Preview of this Workload. 

Once you have been invited, you can search and find the CluedIn Cleanse Workload in your Workload Hub.

You will need to attach this Workload to a Workspace, or your entire Tenant - but do make sure you are attaching it to an environment that has capacity assocaited with it. Trial capacties are supported.

**Requirements**

Firstly, please follow the Microsoft Fabric documentation in order to know if you have the rights and authorization to be able to install Workloads in your Fabric environment. 

Secondly, you will need to bring your own CluedIn instance and pass the details of it into the Workload (as you can see in the video above). If you do not have a CluedIn instance, you can get a free PAAS instance from the Azure Marketplace.
