## Sync Purview Glossaries to CluedIn Glossaries

![Settings Sync Purview Glossaries to CluedIn Glossaries](../media/settings-sync-purview-glossaries-to-cluedin-glossaries.png)

When this feature is enabled, a CluedIn glossary category with the default name **Purview** is automatically created. The glossary category name is configurable in **Organization** > **Settings**. All Purview glossary terms (excluding names containing "CluedIn-" prefix) are synced under this glossary category. New glossary terms created under this glossary category are ignored.
