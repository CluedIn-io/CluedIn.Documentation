With over 90 built-in connectors, Azure Data Factory (ADF) enables you to acquire data from a wide range of sources such as relational databases, big data and NoSQL systems, data lakes and storages, and many more. These connectors empower ADF to extract, transform, and load data from diverse systems for seamless integration and analytics.

With ADF integration, you can leverage CluedInâ€™s core capabilities in data quality and enrichment to ensure that the data is clean, reliable, and ready for insights.

For successful integration between ADF and CluedIn, you need to meet a couple of prerequisites:

- Your CluedIn instance needs to be publicly accessible via the internet so that ADF can connect to it.

- You need to create an ingestion endpoint in CluedIn where the data from ADF will be sent. For more information, see [Endpoint](/integration/endpoint).

- You need to create an API token in CluedIn that will be used to authenticate your post requests.

- You need to have a source dataset in ADF ready to be sent to CluedIn.
