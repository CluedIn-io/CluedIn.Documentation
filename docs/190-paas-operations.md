CluedIn team performs installation activities on all business days **except Friday**. Deploying on a Friday carries higher risk because issues may not surface immediately and can escalate into weekend incidents with fewer people available to respond. As a best practice, it is recommended to schedule installations earlier in the week (Tuesdayâ€“Thursday) to allow time for monitoring, troubleshooting, and stabilization.
