## Part 1

**Level:** Beginner

In this training, we’ll focus on building a single customer view by identifying and merging duplicate records. We’ll explore the concept of primary identifiers in CluedIn and how to use them to proactively unify duplicate data into a single, accurate customer view.

**Presented by:** Jocelyn Ramirez and Matthew Carter, your CluedIn AI trainers

## Part 2

**Level:** Beginner

In this training, we’ll explore an alternative approach to identifying and merging duplicate records as part of building a single, unified customer view—a deduplication project. You’ll learn how to set up and work with a deduplication project, understand when this method is most effective, and see how it compares to other deduplication strategies, such as merging by identifiers.

## Part 3

**Level:** Beginner

In this training, we'll explore strategies for defining the uniqueness of records—particularly in situations where the property used to generate a primary or additional identifier is missing or empty. In CluedIn, when two or more records share the same identifier—whether it’s primary or additional—they will be merged into a single golden record. That’s why it’s important to always use valid, unique identifiers.

## Part 4

**Level:** Beginner

In this training, we'll learn how to identify and resolve data quality issues using CluedIn’s edit mode and validations. This helps fix invalid or incomplete identifiers before processing, ensuring more accurate matching and preventing unintended merges across your data.
