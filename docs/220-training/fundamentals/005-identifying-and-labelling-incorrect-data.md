---

**Module:** [1.1. Ingestion](/training/fundamentals/ingestion)

**Level:** Beginner

In this session, we’ll learn how to identify and label invalid records using tags. We’ll explore different types of tags—such as structural, data quality, and business logic tags—and understand how each can be applied to highlight specific data issues. This approach helps streamline data cleanup, improve data quality, and ensure that invalid records are clearly marked for review or correction.

**Presented by:** Jocelyn Ramirez, your Customer Success Manager, and Matthew Carter, your CluedIn AI Trainer
