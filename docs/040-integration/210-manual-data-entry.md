In addition to loading data from various sources, you can also enter data manually. The **Manual data entry** module allows you to create records directly in CluedIn. This way, you can capture data that may not be available from other sources but is necessary for your data management purposes.

Manual data entry is used to create records in an enforced and structured manner. This means that the Administrator sets up a manual data entry project and defines the schema that will be used to create the records. Data Stewards are then tasked with creating records according to this schema.
