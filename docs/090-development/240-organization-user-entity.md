The Organization Entity Type is a very special Entity type, where by marking one of your Clues as an Organization, then many "smarts" of the CluedIn processing engine will kick in. 

If you have enabled the CluedIn Web Crawler (External Search) and that you have mapped a value for the Organization Website Vocabulary, then the inbuilt Web Crawler for CluedIn will lookup that website and will crawl the website for extra information.
