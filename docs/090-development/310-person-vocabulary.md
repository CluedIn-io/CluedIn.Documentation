The CluedIn Person Vocabulary is a very important Vocabulary. By mapping your custom Clue Vocabularies into this core Person Vocabulary, a lot of "smarts" will kick in on the processing server to help automate cleaning, normalization, insights and more. 

This Vocabulary also includes Vocabulary mappings for all the popular Social Accounts and it is worth mentioning that if you have two Clues that have the same Social Accounts then by default, these Clues will merge with 100% confidence if they are valid representations of those values.
