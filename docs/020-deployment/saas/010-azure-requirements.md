**Azure account**

The first requirement is an Azure account. If you already have an Azure account, you can proceed to the next requirement. If you don't have an Azure account, you can easily create a [pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/search/?ef_id=_k_EAIaIQobChMIwOntxpn2hAMV_AYGAB3AMAFmEAAYASAAEgJ8LPD_BwE_k_&OCID=AIDcmmbnk3rt9z_SEM__k_EAIaIQobChMIwOntxpn2hAMV_AYGAB3AMAFmEAAYASAAEgJ8LPD_BwE_k_&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwOntxpn2hAMV_AYGAB3AMAFmEAAYASAAEgJ8LPD_BwE) account using a valid credit card.

**Marketplace purchases and Contributor role**

Make sure that you have enabled marketplace purchases and configured the required user permissions (at least **Contributor**) for the subscription where you want to store the CluedIn SaaS application. For more information, see [Enable marketplace purchases in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/enable-marketplace-purchases).
