CluedIn Private SaaS is a premium deployment model that provides each customer with a fully isolated and dedicated CluedIn environment. Unlike the standard multi-tenant SaaS offering, Private SaaS runs in a separate tenant with its own infrastructure, ensuring enhanced security, compliance, performance, and data isolation. CluedIn manages and maintains the environment, while customers benefit from enterprise-grade controls and the ability to scale independently of the shared SaaS platform.

CluedIn team performs installation activities on all business days **except Friday**. Deploying on a Friday carries higher risk because issues may not surface immediately and can escalate into weekend incidents with fewer people available to respond. As a best practice, it is recommended to schedule installations earlier in the week (Tuesday–Thursday) to allow time for monitoring, troubleshooting, and stabilization.
