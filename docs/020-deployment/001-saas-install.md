CluedIn Private SaaS is a premium deployment model that provides each customer with a fully isolated and dedicated CluedIn environment. Unlike the standard multi-tenant SaaS offering, Private SaaS runs in a separate tenant with its own infrastructure, ensuring enhanced security, compliance, performance, and data isolation. CluedIn manages and maintains the environment, while customers benefit from enterprise-grade controls and the ability to scale independently of the shared SaaS platform.

## Purchase Options

CluedIn offers flexible purchase options designed to meet the procurement needs of organizations of all sizes. Whether you prefer a traditional invoicing process or want to consolidate your software spending through the Azure Marketplace, CluedIn supports multiple commercial pathways. Choose the option that best aligns with your internal procurement workflows, financial policies, and cloud strategy.

### Transact directly with CluedIn

For organizations that prefer a straightforward commercial relationship, CluedIn supports direct transactions via classic invoicing. In this model, CluedIn issues invoices directly to your company based on your selected plan and usage. This option is ideal for customers who want simple, predictable billing and a direct point of contact with CluedIn throughout the purchasing and renewal process.

### Transact through the Azure Marketplace

CluedIn is also available as a transactable offer in the Azure Marketplace, enabling customers to purchase through their existing Microsoft commercial agreement. This option is especially beneficial for companies with a MACC agreement or those who prefer to consolidate all cloud-related spending into a single Microsoft bill. By transacting through the Azure Marketplace, organizations can streamline procurement, leverage committed cloud spend, and simplify financial operations.

CluedIn team performs installation activities on all business days **except Friday**. Deploying on a Friday carries higher risk because issues may not surface immediately and can escalate into weekend incidents with fewer people available to respond. As a best practice, it is recommended to schedule installations earlier in the week (Tuesday–Thursday) to allow time for monitoring, troubleshooting, and stabilization.
