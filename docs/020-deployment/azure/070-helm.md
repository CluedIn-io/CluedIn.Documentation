[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is the package manager for Kubernetes.

CluedIn provides a Helm chart to install CluedIn quickly in a Kubernetes cluster. [*Helm*](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager that simplifies complex applications' installation and management in a Kubernetes environment. The Helm charts (i.e., packages) are stored in a repository, and you can install a chart by invoking a command-line tool from a terminal that has access to a Kubernetes cluster.

You can find CluedIn Helm Charts in the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/CluedIn-io/Charts).
