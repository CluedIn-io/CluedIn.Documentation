The CluedIn licensing agent is delivered as an [Azure Managed Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/overview) and is installed via the Azure Marketplace. It enables CluedIn to bill customers directly through the Marketplace.

The installation process is straightforward:

1. You complete a short form, which then provisions a Managed Application in the customerâ€™s Azure subscription.

1. Once installed, any agreed CluedIn charges can be billed to that subscription.

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure account**. If you already have an Azure account, you can proceed to the next prerequisite. If you do not have an Azure account, create a [pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/search/?ef_id=_k_EAIaIQobChMIwOntxpn2hAMV_AYGAB3AMAFmEAAYASAAEgJ8LPD_BwE_k_&OCID=AIDcmmbnk3rt9z_SEM__k_EAIaIQobChMIwOntxpn2hAMV_AYGAB3AMAFmEAAYASAAEgJ8LPD_BwE_k_&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwOntxpn2hAMV_AYGAB3AMAFmEAAYASAAEgJ8LPD_BwE) account using a valid credit card.

1. **Marketplace purchases and Contributor role**. Make sure that you have enabled Marketplace purchases and configured the required user permissions (at least **Contributor**) for the subscription where you want to store the CluedIn SaaS application. For more information, see [Enable marketplace purchases in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/enable-marketplace-purchases).

        You may also select an existing resource group, but it must be empty. If the selected resource group contains other Azure resources, an error will occur.
