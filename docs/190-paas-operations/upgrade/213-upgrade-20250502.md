This document covers the upgrade process from 2025.05.00 to 2025.05.02.

{:.important}
We do not support upgrading directly to this version from prior to 2025.05.00

## Prerequisites
- Access to the helm chart version `2.5.1`. You may need to `helm repo update` to grab the latest.
- `kubectl` and `helm`

## Guide

{:.important}
Before any upgrade takes place, ensure you have taken a snapshot or **backup of all your running PVCs** in your AKS cluster. This is very important as databases may be upgraded during this process.

### Stage 1: Prepare for Upgrade

  1. Connect to your cluster via the kubeconfig.
  1. Export your current running helm values file. Keep one for this process, and also keep one as a backup.
  1. In the values file we'll be working with, update the following properties:

      ```yaml
      global:
        image:
          tag: "2025.05.02"
        strategy:
          type: Recreate

        gql:
          hubSpotToken: <pat-token>
      ```
  1. Apply the values file from your shell by running the following:

      ```bash
      # ${CustomValues} refers to the values file you have amended with the above changes. Please type the full path here.

      helm upgrade cluedin-platform -n cluedin cluedin/cluedin-platform \
          --version 2.5.1 \
          --values ${CustomValues} \
          --set application.system.runDatabaseJobsOnUpgrade=true \
          --set application.system.runNugetFullRestore=true \
          --wait \
          --timeout 10m0s
      ```
      After a few minutes, it should successfully complete.

      1. Validation:

      - ❗ Wait until deployment finishes. Make sure that all pods are healthy and all jobs are completed.
      - ❗ Don't proceed further if any of the pods have health issues. Rather investigate the issues.
        This will apply dynamic mappings to every CluedIn index
      - Ensure no errors in the pod logs.
      - Verify the server starts in normal mode.
      - Ensure cluedin-ui pod is Running..

If there are any issues during the upgrade process, please do not hesitate to reach out to CluedIn support.
