This document covers the upgrade process from 2025.05.02 to 2025.09.00.

{:.important}
We do not support upgrading directly to this version from prior to 2025.05.02.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the Helm chart version `2.6.0`. You may need to run `helm repo update` to grab the latest version.
- [kubectl](/paas-operations/upgrade/guide/required-tools#kubectl)
- [Helm](/paas-operations/upgrade/guide/required-tools#helm)

## Guide

{:.important}
Before any upgrade takes place, ensure you have taken a snapshot or **backup of all your running PVCs** in your AKS cluster. This is very important as databases may be upgraded during this process.

### Stage 1: Prepare for upgrade

  1. Connect to your cluster using the kubeconfig.

  1. Export your current Helm values file. Keep one copy for the upgrade process and another as a backup.

  1. In the values file, update the following properties:

      ```yaml
      global:
        image:
          tag: "2025.09.00"
        strategy:
          type: Recreate

            - name: "CluedIn.Provider.ExternalSearch.Providers.ArtificialIntelligence"
              version: "4.6.0"

      ```
  1. Apply the values file from your shell by running the following:

      ```bash
      # ${CustomValues} refers to the values file you have amended with the above changes. Please type the full path here.

      helm upgrade cluedin-platform -n cluedin cluedin/cluedin-platform \
          --version 2.6.0 \
          --values ${CustomValues} \
          --set application.system.upgradeMode=true \
          --set application.system.runDatabaseJobsOnUpgrade=true \
          --set application.system.runNugetFullRestore=true \
          --wait \
          --timeout 10m0s
      ```
      After a few minutes, it should complete successfully.

1. Wait until the deployment finishes.

1. Perform the validation:

    - Make sure that all pods are healthy and all jobs are completed.

        {:.important}
        Do not proceed if any pods show health issues. Investigate and resolve the issues before continuing. This will apply dynamic mappings to every CluedIn index.
        
    - Ensure that there are no errors in the pod logs.

    - Confirm that the server starts in normal mode.

    - Verify that the **cluedin-ui** pod is running.

If there are any issues during the upgrade process, please do not hesitate to reach out to CluedIn support.

### Stage 2: Run Data Upgrade

  1. Apply data upgrade by running following command:
      ```bash
      kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
      apiVersion: api.cluedin.com/v1
      kind: DataUpgrade
      metadata:
        annotations:
          meta.helm.sh/release-name: cluedin-platform
          meta.helm.sh/release-namespace: cluedin
        labels:
          app: cluedin
          app.kubernetes.io/instance: cluedin-platform
          app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
          app.kubernetes.io/name: application
          helm.sh/chart: application-2.6.0
          release: cluedin-platform
        name: data-upgrade-460
        namespace: cluedin
      spec:
        toVersion: Version460
      EOF
      ```

  1. Validation:

      - ❗ Confirm the data upgrade completed successfully.

### Stage 3: Finalize Upgrade

1. Run the final stage of the upgrade to bring the system back online (disable upgrade mode):

    ```bash
    # ${CustomValues} refers to the values file you have amended with the above changes. Please type the full path here.

    helm upgrade cluedin-platform -n cluedin cluedin/cluedin-platform \
      --version 2.6.0 \
      --values ${CustomValues} \
      --set application.system.upgradeMode=false \
      --set application.system.runDatabaseJobsOnUpgrade=false \
      --set application.system.runNugetFullRestore=false
    ```

1. Validation:
    - Ensure no errors in the pod logs.
    - Verify the server starts in normal mode.
    - Ensure cluedin-ui pod is Running..
