Edge Types

Edges Types are a way to determine the relationships between data. This is typically in the structure of a Object - Verb - Object. For example, John works at Lego. In CluedIn, edges can store properties such as weights and general metadata, but the main idea behind these edges is to describe the relationship for processing and querying purposes. 

In CluedIn, there are static Edge Types and Dynamic Edge Types. Static Edge Types are your way to set an Edge Type based off known rules that will not change. All other Edge Types should be Dynamic.
