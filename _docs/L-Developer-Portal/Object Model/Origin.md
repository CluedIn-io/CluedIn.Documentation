Origin

The Origin of a Clue determins the lineage of source. Dependant upon the use case, you might find that sometimes your Origin will differ based of different fields. For example, imagine you are pulling data in from Microsoft Dynamics, but you are aware that one of the fields on a Lead object in Microsoft Dynamics actually comes from a particular Oracle database. It is fine to be able to set the Origin of this Clue to a hybrid of Oracle and Microsoft Dynamics.  This will also help CluedIn reconstruct the full data lineage path of where data comes from and where it flows. 

An Origin can be any value, but typically it will be the name of the source system where you are pulling data from e.g. Hubspot, Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle, Workday.
