Thumbnail Extractors

Thumbnail Extractors allow you to extract images from Data. The most common use case would be to set a Preview Image of a Clue. This is common for files such as Presentations, Spreadsheets and Videos to have a sample picture to preview what the file looks like. 

There may be times where you are integrating datasources that are not supported by CluedIn. For this, you can create a new thumbnail extractor by creating a new C# class and inheriting from the IThumbnailExtractor interface.
