Engine Room

The processing pipeline in CluedIn can be described as a Graph of different processing steps. Each processing step has dependencies on previous steps being run and hence you can conceptualise it as a dependency tree of processing steps. 

The Engine Room is a visualisation of this processing workflow. It will give you statistics on amount of data processing in a particular state, error rates and will even allow you to introduce new processing sub-workflows. 

If you have added an integration to your account, the Engine Room will be able to report on what state that data is in the overall process. It will also help you gauge how much infrastructure you will need to scale to the point where you can keep up with the number of processing servers required.
