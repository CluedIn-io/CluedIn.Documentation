CluedIn Train

In data there are rules and then there is data that does not abide to any rules. These fuzzy pieces of data cannot be catalogued or solved with classic business rules. CluedIn Train is a reinforcement learning platform that allows you to train CluedIn to curate and steward data that does not abide by rules. Amongst other use cases, common use cases for CluedIn Train include: 

- Detecing objects in unstructured text (Named Entity Recognition)

How long do I need to train for before this system becomes useful?

This is a very valid question, but it also is not easy to answer. However, what is clear is that CluedIn Train will prompt you with a confidence level as to indicate if the system is getting more and more confident. You can use this confidence mechanism to help you understand when the system is ready to take over in making decisions on your behalf based off historical and present data.
