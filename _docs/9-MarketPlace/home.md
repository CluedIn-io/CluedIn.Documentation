## CluedIn Integrations MarketPlace

The [MarketPlace](https://cluedin-marketplace.herokuapp.com) brings your CluedIn installation to life.

CluedIn is usually shipped with few or no integrations, it means that until you plugged some in nothing much will happen.

The MarketPlace is where you will find all those integrations. It offers several types of integration you can add to your set up.

Some integration fetch data (Connectors), some enrich data (Enrichers), some allow configuring an export target for data (Export Target - coming soon) and much more...



### Connectors

The first step after having installed CluedIn is usually to bring data in. 

This is done using an [Connector](https://cluedin-marketplace.herokuapp.com/search?type=connector).

If you were to not find what you are looking for in the MarketPlace, you can always [build an integration](/docs/1-Integration/build-integration.html) yourself.



### Enricher

[Enricher](https://cluedin-marketplace.herokuapp.com/search?type=enricher) enables you to enrich data by using external sources.
