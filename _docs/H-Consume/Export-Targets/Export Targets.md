Export Targets are used to authenticate with an integration point with the intention that CluedIn will make data available to this consumer via a push mechanish that CluedIn calls Outgoing Streams. Good examples include: 

 - Business Intelligence Tools
 - Data Warehouse Dimension Tables
 - Machine Learning Platforms
 - Custom Applications
 - Databases

Here are two examples of how to build a new Export Target:

[SQL Server](https://github.com/CluedIn-io/CluedIn.Connector.SqlServer)
[Snowflake](https://github.com/CluedIn-io/CluedIn.Connector.Snowflake)
