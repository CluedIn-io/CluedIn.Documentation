Rest API

The CluedIn Web User Interface is driven off the Rest API. This means that whatever you can do the User Interface can also be automated and programmatically called from systems. Everything from creating new accounts, to adding integrations, to running searches can all be run through the Rest API. 

This can be very handy if you are wanting to completely automate the deployment process of your CluedIn account. For example, if you had a task to add 300 SharePoint instances to CluedIn then you can use the Rest API with your scripting language of choice to automate this.
