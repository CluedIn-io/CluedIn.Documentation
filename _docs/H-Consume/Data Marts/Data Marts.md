Data Marts

Data Marts allow you to prepare certain data sets for future consumption. Unlike a Stream, a Data Mart is not necessarily yet data that is being made available to any consumers, but at the same time you might find that a Data Mart is consumed multiple times. 

The idea behind a Data Mart in CluedIn is to logically group a certain collection of data in which you can apply operations directly to just that data and nothing else. Examples include:

 - Being able to have Data Quality Metrics on a particular subset of data. 
 - Being able to Clean a paritcular subset of data. 
 - Being able to expose what the data in a Data Mart is being used for (Showcasing)
