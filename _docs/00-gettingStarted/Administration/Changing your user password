Changing your user password

If you have decided to not use your Single Sign On provider to authenticate with your CluedIn instance, then you have the possiblity to change your password by clicking on the user profile in the top right hand corner of the user interface and selecting "Settings". This will ask you to fill in your existing password, your new password and then confirm your new password again.
