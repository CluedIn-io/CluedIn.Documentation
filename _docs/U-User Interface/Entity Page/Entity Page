Entity Page


On the Entity Page you will be able to see your visual view of a Record. CluedIn will automatically choose which properties from which systems are the most accuract and hence are the ones that we will natively display in the user interface as the "Golden Value".

CluedIn has 3 possible mechanisms to choose the "Golden Value".

1: Latest Modified Date
2: Highest mean value across metrics
3: Highest mean value across metrics combined with the trust level set at the integration level.
