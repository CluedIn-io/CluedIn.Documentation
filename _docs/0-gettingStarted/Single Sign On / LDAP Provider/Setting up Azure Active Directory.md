Setting up Azure Active Directory

You will most likely want to integrate your CluedIn account with you LDAP provider and if this is Azure Active Directory, then this will guide you through the process. 

Navigate to the "Administration" menu on your left hand side of the user interface and then select "Authentication".

Click on the "Change Authentication Type" and select "Azure Active Directory" from the list. 

You will be prompted to fill in 4 values that you can get from your Azure Portal. Click Save, once you have entered the data and click "Sign Out" in the top right hand corner. On the CluedIn login page, it will now automatically redirect to your Single Sign On provider to authorize and login with your Azure Active Directory credentials.
