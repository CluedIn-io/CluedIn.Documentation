### Organization

CluedIn can support multi-tenancy (disabled by default).

As such, the first thing you need to do for using CluedIn once installed is to create an organization.

### Pre-requirement

- A configured SMTP

By default, CluedIn is not shipping with any SMTP servers. You need to setup it before creating your organization.

Emails are transactional emails. You won't receive marketing email. They are emails to inform you of some important actions that was taken by your users using your CluedIn installation and/or emails used for security check (signup, change password, invitation...)
