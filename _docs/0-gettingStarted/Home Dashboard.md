Home Dashboard

Your home screen will show you notifications and high-level actions that span your entire CluedIn account. For each major pillar of CluedIn, you will have the most important notifications and actions and you can drill into your respective menu options to explore more notifications and actions specific to that part of the application. 

You can click on the notifications to see more details. The main concept of the home screen and the notifications is to direct you towards actioning a task that needs actioning. Such actions include:

 - Integrations that have lost connectivity due to authentication issues.
 - Number of Entity Types
