Home Dashboard

Your CluedIn Dashboard will show 4 main functions. On the "My Work" tab, it will show you records that are connected to you, the logged in user. The "My Organization" will show you all records that are linked to your Account.

You will also see your Launchpad, which will show you the tools you have added and link you to the Url of that tool. 

Finally, the "Your Schedule" will show you Entities of type "/Calendar/Event" that involve you, ordered by the date of the event. 

If you find that your Home Dashboard is empty, it may be because the credentials that you used for your CluedIn account, is different to the values for records that have been integrated. You may need to manually merge your user account in CluedIn with the records on your from the different integration points.
