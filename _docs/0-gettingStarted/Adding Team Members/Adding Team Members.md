Adding Team Members

New team members can be added to an existing account via their email address. This new member is by default added as a "User" and it is the responsibility of an Administrator to change their roles after they have entered the system. Users must have a matching email domain if using the manual approach of User management.

The recommendation is to use an LDAP / Single Sign On Provider for managing users and groups within CluedIn. In this way, Users are provisioned through Active Directory and no sensitive user information is ever store on the CluedIn side. This also allows you to manage access, users and roles from a central place. 

Step 1: To invite a new user to CluedIn, navigate to the Users menu option and click on the "Administration" menu option and click on "Users". You will see a breakdown of roles and users. In the top right hand corner there is a button "Invite a New Team Member". 

Step 2: You will be prompted with the ability to fill in an email. This can be internal or external users. They will receive an email that will be able to guide them through the process. 

If you click on the "Suggested Users" tab, CluedIn will suggest people to invite based off the data you have already added to CluedIn. This allows you to discover users you might not have though about adding.
