Adding Team Members

New team members can be added to an existing account via their email address. This new member is by default added as a "User" and it is the responsibility of an Administrator to change their roles after they have entered the system. Users must have a matching email domain if using the manual approach of User management.

The recommendation is to use an LDAP / Single Sign On Provider for managing users and groups within CluedIn. In this way, Users are provisioned through Active Directory and no sensitive user information is ever store on the CluedIn side. This also allows you to manage access from a central place.
