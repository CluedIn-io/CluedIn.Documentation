Theme

You can change your theme of the user interface in CluedIn. This might be something you may do to add a more natural branding to your company. You can change the colours of the user interface by navigating to the "Administration" and then the "Theme" menu option. 

Remember to click the "Save Colours" button after you have made your changes. This change affects every user in the account, not just yourself.
