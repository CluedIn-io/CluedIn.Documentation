title: Generating an API Token
---

To consume that from CluedIn, you may need to generate an API token so that external sources can talk to CluedIn through its GraphQL endpoint. 

To generate a new API token, you can head to the Settings part of CluedIn where it will ask you to give the API Token a name. You can generate as many API Tokens as necessary and you can revoke these tokens, which will render them depreciated and unable to communicate with CluedIn via the Rest API anymore.
