Data Catalog

Using the Vocabularies in your integrations, CluedIn will automatically build you up a Data Catalog of all the properties that are available across all integrations that have been enabled in the platform. 

This means that the Catalog will give you a list of all property names, both Core and Provider Specific Vocabulary Keys that exist. This means that that these will be the exact property names that you will use to query data out of CluedIn.
