If it were, your data would already be in perfect shape. 2. Ensure organizational readiness. MDM is not just about having the right tools; it is also about how prepared your organization is to embrace change and prioritize data quality in decision-making. By reading these lines, it’s clear you already value data quality. However, we must also acknowledge that resistance is inevitable. Challenging the status quo is always hard, but you made the right choice by picking CluedIn, and we have strategies to overcome this resistance. 3. Overcome resistance with value. Resistance can come from various quarters—departments unwilling or unable to share data, technical challenges, firewalls, security, and permissions issues. These obstacles are normal, and we are experienced in dealing with them. The key to turning detractors into supporters lies in demonstrating value. ",

It offers a code-free UI for intuitive authoring and single-pane-of-glass monitoring and management. | Azure Synapse Analytics – a limitless analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics. It supports both SQL-based and Spark-based analytics, enabling a wide range of data processing and analysis tasks. | Databricks – a unified analytics platform that integrates with cloud data storage, allowing for efficient data processing and management. It provides a web interface where you can create a notebook that connects to Spark, allowing you to perform data transformation tasks. From the data architecture standpoint, the purpose of Databricks is similar to Microsoft Fabric since both platforms provide robust tools for managing and processing large volumes of data. | . These source systems usually retrieve data from data storages—data lake, delta lake, OneLake, or SQL Server. Then, they send the source data to CluedIn using an ingestion endpoint. Regardless of the source system, the pipelines for sending the source data to the ingestion endpoint in CluedIn are similar. Your data architecture might also include additional elements such as: . | Data storage services: . | Data Lake – a storage repository that holds a large amount of data in its native, raw format. | OneLake – a single, unified, logical data lake for the whole organization. OneLake comes automatically with every Microsoft Fabric tenant with no infrastructure to manage. Essentially, the purpose of Data Lake and OneLake is similar as they both serve as centralized repositories for storing large volumes of data. However, OneLake is specifically designed for integration within the Microsoft Fabric ecosystem. | . | Data processing services: . | Apache Spark – a distributed processing system designed for big data workloads. It provides a multi-language analytics engine for large-scale data engineering and data processing. Spark is integrated into Microsoft Fabric, which allows for fast data processing using notebooks. Spark can read data both from Data Lake and OneLake. | SQL Pool – provides scalable and high-performance SQL-based analytics capabilities. It integrates seamlessly Fabric Warehouse to enable comprehensive data processing and analytics workflows. | . | Subsystems in Fabric: . | Lakehouse – a data architecture platform for storing, managing, and analyzing structured and unstructured data in a single location. You can read the data stored in the Lakehouse through Spark. | Warehouse – a next-generation data warehousing solution within Microsoft Fabric designed to provide high performance and scalability while simplifying configuration and management.​ A Warehouse in Fabric is essentially a SQL Pool. | . | . These elements will be illustrated further down when we look at the use cases for each source system. ",

    "content": "Data for an MDM project is typically characterized by ease of access, criticality, and completeness. In this section, we explore how these characteristics influence the data you select for your use cases and provide a recommended approach to demonstrate the value of your MDM project. Ease of access vs. Criticality . We always advise you to strike a balance between the ease of access and the criticality of your data. If you want your MDM project to be successful, you will need it to operate on the data that is the most valuable to you. However, from time to time, the access to this data can be restricted or time-consuming as it requires multiple approval steps and buy-in from the business department before starting. Criticality vs. Completeness . The main data ingestion principle for your first use case is: “Focus on the critical data you have access to and start with a simple implementation”. That is why we believe that is probably more important for you to demonstrate value on a sample of critical data rather than having a full solution on the sources that are deemed “nice to have”. So, always favor criticality over completeness. Recommended approach . At the start of your MDM project, use data that will showcase the full value of your MDM solution. Avoid focusing on “nice-to-have” use cases where you may have full access but struggle to gain business buy-in. For a businessperson, seeing a full solution for 10,000 records is a strong proof of value. You can demonstrate the solution, gather feedback, and start preparing your next use cases. This approach aligns with agile methodology, allowing your team to work on new use cases with business stakeholders based on the feedback received, while simultaneously growing the number of records in the test and production environments.

    "content": "The data impact quadrant is a tool that helps you visualize and assess data based on two key criteria: impact and access to data. The purpose of the data impact quadrant is to help you map your sources of data and your business domains in order to evaluate where you should spend your time first. What are the goals of your data impact quadrant? . | Understand where you can gain value with minimal effort within your organization. While it can be challenging to access critical data, this approach will at least align your team with expectations and keep project stakeholders in the line of business (LOB) informed. | Understand what can and cannot be delivered at the start of the project. We’ve often seen data teams face pressure due to misaligned expectations from the start. It’s not uncommon for people in the line of business (LOB) to have unrealistic timelines, especially when the data team hasn’t even received the necessary data to begin with. Therefore, it’s crucial to follow the workshop and present workshop results to your stakeholders. By doing so, you can communicate the criticality of your demands and the impact of any delays to your stakeholders. | Understand what blockers may arise for each source of data. Create the risk assessment matrix that you can update over time and share with your business stakeholders. Sometimes, a good critical escalation call can unlock the majority of your needs that you were waiting to resolve for months. So, make sure to track the blockers on the source of data. An MDM project requires access to critical data, and you need to be clear that to deliver the value, you will need access to it. | . How can critical escalation lead to better project alignment? . Early in the process, you may need to escalate critical issues. While this may not be a call you like to have, it is often necessary. We’ve seen data teams work on use cases that provided minimal value from the stakeholders’ perspective, leading to bigger problems down the line and even project cancellations. To avoid this, we encourage you to raise your voice internally and maintain transparency with your stakeholders. If they’re not on board, you may face negativity and high pressure later, having to change use cases or sources extremely fast due to misalignment between your work and stakeholder expectations. We recommend providing at least a monthly demo and status update to ensure stakeholders in the line of business (LOB) are aware of the current situation, as well as the sources and tasks you’re working on.

    "content": "Now that you understand the importance of the data impact quadrant, let’s explore how it works. Follow this link to find a ready-to-use Miro board for conducting the data impact quadrant exercise with your team. Alternatively, you can use other tools to conduct exercise. The following image illustrates the data impact quadrant created during a workshop. Generally, the data impact workshop consists of 5 steps. Step 1: Identify critical data sources . The first step is to identify your data sources. What is critical data? . To find out what your critical data is, answer the following questions: . | If I remove this source, can my company operate without interruption? . | If the answer is yes, this is not critical data. | If the answer is no, it may be critical data. | . | If I remove this source, what monetary impacts would it have? . | If I remove this source, the entire operation line is down. This would indicate that the source is critical. | If I remove this source, our sales team cannot sell any more. This would indicate that the source is critical. | If I remove this source, our support team cannot operate. This would indicate that the source might be critical. | . | . We cannot really do this exercise for you, all we can do is to help you ask the right questions. However, if your MDM project does not involve critical data, be aware that you may need to put in extra effort to demonstrate its value to business stakeholders and management. While we cannot determine what your company deems critical, we can assist you in that process. Step 2: List data sources . The second step is to list each source with a brief description and assign a priority to each. | Priority | Source | Description | Value for MDM | . | 1. | CRM | Hold all the information we have around our customers | Required normalization work as lots of manual work on reporting | . | 2. | ERP | Hold all the business domain important for our production | Disconnected from the CRM detail that should be hold the truth | . | 3. | … | … |   | . Step 3: List business domains . The third step is to add business domains for each source. Keep in mind that there may be overlap. | Priority | Domain | Source | Value for MDM | . | 1. | Customer | CRM | Represent who buys our services/products | . | 2. | Prospect | CRM | Represent a potential customer | . | 3. | Deals | CRM | Represent a deal that is signed or sent | . | 4. | Customer | ERP | Represent who will get our products | . | 5. | Product | ERP | Represent the product we are selling | . | 6. | Shipping Info | ERP | Represent the shipping contact for a given customer | . Step 4: Put sources with domains on the quadrant . The fourth step is to place the sources along with domains on the quadrant. Each of your team members should place the sources along with business domains on the quadrant. It’s important for your team to discuss and align on what they consider “critical” and what they perceive as hard or easy to access. One team member might have access you weren’t aware of, or you might have different perspectives on what defines critical data. Now is a good time to have those conversations and reach alignment. Step 5: Create a list with your priorities . Once you’ve reached an agreement, create a list of data sources, starting from the top right and moving to the bottom left, to establish your priorities. The following image shows the direction in which you should list the data sources. The following table is an example of what the result of the exercise might look like. | Priority | Domain | Source | Value for MDM | . | 1. | Customer | CRM | Represent who buys our services/products | . | 2. | Customer | ERP | Represent who will get our products | . | 3. | Shipping Info | ERP | Represent the shipping contact for a given customer | . | 4. | Product | ERP | Represent the product we are selling | . | 4. | Deals | CRM | Represent a deal that is signed or sent | . | 5. | Prospect | CRM | Represent a potential customer | . With this result, we know we need to work with Customers and with the ERP and the CRM source first. We already have the start of a plan. ",

    "content": "CluedIn offers flexible purchase options designed to meet the procurement needs of organizations of all sizes. Whether you prefer a traditional invoicing process or want to consolidate your software spending through the Azure Marketplace, CluedIn supports multiple commercial pathways. Choose the option that best aligns with your internal procurement workflows, financial policies, and cloud strategy. Transact directly with CluedIn . For organizations that prefer a straightforward commercial relationship, CluedIn supports direct transactions via classic invoicing. In this model, CluedIn issues invoices directly to your company based on your selected plan and usage. This option is ideal for customers who want simple, predictable billing and a direct point of contact with CluedIn throughout the purchasing and renewal process. Transact through the Azure Marketplace . CluedIn is also available as a transactable offer in the Azure Marketplace, enabling customers to purchase through their existing Microsoft commercial agreement. This option is especially beneficial for companies with a MACC agreement or those who prefer to consolidate all cloud-related spending into a single Microsoft bill. By transacting through the Azure Marketplace, organizations can streamline procurement, leverage committed cloud spend, and simplify financial operations. Please refer to the below documentation. CluedIn team performs installation activities on all business days except Friday. Deploying on a Friday carries higher risk because issues may not surface immediately and can escalate into weekend incidents with fewer people available to respond. As a best practice, it is recommended to schedule installations earlier in the week (Tuesday–Thursday) to allow time for monitoring, troubleshooting, and stabilization. Useful resources: . | Installation – learn about the difference between CluedIn Private SaaS and PaaS. | Pricing – learn about our pricing options (monthly or committed deal). | . ",

The backup solution is deployed post-installation and can be done by CluedIn on your behalf. If you do not have the backup solution in place, reach out to CluedIn support for assistance. The backup configuration focuses on two core elements for the CluedIn product. These are the helm values and the persistent databases that run inside of your cluster on disk. The process works by leveraging the automation account deployed to your managed resource group to run two main runbooks. One runbook will back up helm, and the other will back up the databases. During the backup run, it will temporarily shut down the instance by scaling down all the pods running in Kubernetes to prevent any potential data loss. It will then take snapshots of each persistent disk and place these inside the managed resource group by default. Once a backup has happened, it will reduce total snapshots to the supplied retention count (default is 7), starting with the oldest existing snapshot before scaling CluedIn up. This process takes roughly 20 minutes to complete and is highly recommended to run out of hours. To set up the schedules . | Navigate to the automation account located in the managed resource group of the environment that you want to back up. | On the left side, select Schedules . | Select Add a schedule, and then specify the appropriate time, time zone, and days to run the backup.

Several of its key components—Power Apps, Power Automate, and Dataverse—can be integrated with CluedIn. The most common use case of Power Platform integration involves using a Power Apps form for data input and a Power Automate workflow for approving the data input. Once the input is approved, it is written to the Dataverse table. The Dataverse table is then synchronized with CluedIn and the updated data is sent to the ingestion endpoint. Once the data is in CluedIn, it undergoes processing and becomes a data part of an existing golden record, which is then sent to the Dataverse export target by stream. The above use case is specific for data changes in the source system. In addition to this, CluedIn offers in-app Workflow module for streamlining and tracking approvals and notifications for specific activities happening in CluedIn. For example, you can set up a workflow to notify the owners of a vocabulary key when other users make changes. The owners will receive an approval request in Outlook or the Approvals app in Teams, where they can approve or reject the changes. The changes will be applied only if at least one of the owners approves them. To sum up, if you want to implement a process for approving and syncing data entry changes from Dataverse to CluedIn, consider using Power Platform integration. ",

    "title": "Start small",
    "content": "Regardless of your use case, we always recommend starting your data project in CluedIn with a limited number of records from one or several data sources. By experiencing full CluedIn cycle—ingest, clean, deduplicate, and stream—on a small scale first, you can thoroughly understand the process before scaling up in terms of records and sources. Here are the key benefits of starting small: . | Agility and flexibility – quickly adapt and iterate based on immediate feedback. | Fast learning – understand the CluedIn process on a manageable scale. | Quick adjustments – make necessary changes without the overhead of managing vast amounts of data. | Reduced risk – minimize the risk of large-scale failures by perfecting the process on a smaller data set. | . One of our guiding principles is: “Aim for better data, not perfect data”. Striving for 100% perfection from the start often leads to failure, which is why we advocate for an Agile approach. This allows for continuous improvement and adaptation. While CluedIn simplifies MDM processes, handling a vast amount of data from the start can be overwhelming. This is why starting small allows you to tackle these MDM challenges: . | Complexity in MDM steps – each MDM step can introduce significant complexity. Managing 100 records is far easier than managing 1,000,000 records. | Load on source systems – even though CluedIn can handle it efficiently, ingesting millions of records can impose a considerable load on source systems, slowing down your progress and increasing the risk of errors. | IT obstacles – each data introduces a unique set of IT challenges. You might need to contact multiple data owners, navigate permissions, and deal with network security issues. | . What happens if you don’t start small? . Approaching a data project with the traditional Waterfall methodology can be rigid and slow. Initially, you would ingest data from all your data sources. Next, you would clean the data. Only after that would you perform deduplication activities. At any stage, there’s a significant risk of errors due to the large volume of data. Let’s say you have 10 sources, each with 1,000,000 records, and you ingest data from all of them before any cleaning or deduplication activities. This whole process could take months, annoy your IT team, and you would not have improved the quality of your data at all. Suppose you succeeded to ingest those 10,000,000 records. Next, you will have to apply cleaning and deduplication rules on a whole difference scale. Of course, CluedIn allows you to filter down and clean and deduplicate your records on a smaller scale. However, keep in mind that cleaning 1,000 records out of a set of 10,000,000 means that these records can be merged or exported to other parts of the system, such as rules or streams. This means you won’t have control over your data and will be forced to play catch-up to determine what should have been done earlier. Additionally, you’ll need to stream large amounts of data multiple times whenever changes are made. Although CluedIn’s streams are performant, it is always easier to stream 1,000 records, then 10,0000, and finally 10,000,000, rather than streaming 10,000,000 records three times. ",

    "content": "In CluedIn, we believe it is essential to create value as soon as possible. Start by improving small data sets from various sources, and then expand along two dimensions: the number of records and the number of sources. Start with the data you have; don’t wait—improved data is better than your current data. Therefore, focus on creating a virtuous cycle before adding more data. You can start with as little as 10 records and achieve the value immediately. With those 10 records, you can learn how to perform the main tasks in CluedIn: . | Map | Enrich | Clean | Apply business rules | Deduplicate | Stream | . Once you have successfully ingested, cleaned, deduplicated, and streamed a small dataset of 10 records, you can scale up and apply the same process to a larger set of 10,000 records. The more exercises you do, the deeper your understanding of data will become. If you make a mistake at any step, you can always revert your work and try again until you achieve the desired outcome. This iterative process ensures that you add value to your data and enhance your knowledge of CluedIn. Our experience with data projects has shown that initial perceptions of data quality often differ from reality.

CluedIn offers a variety of actions for each rule type to cover the most common data transformation tasks. However, if out-of-the-box actions are not enough, and you need something non-standard, you can write custom rule actions.

After the custom rule action is ready, it will appear in the list of actions for the specific rule type, allowing you to select it while creating a rule. Example of custom data part rule action . One of the examples of custom rule actions if the Enrich action. It provides a flexible way to enrich data in CluedIn with external data sources. The Enrich action requires an API that accepts a list of vocabulary keys and returns a list of properties. The returned properties are saved with a specified vocabulary prefix. The API can be implemented as an Azure Function, a REST API, or any other service that can be accessed via HTTP. The API is also responsible for getting the data from the external source, processing it, and returning the properties to CluedIn. The Enrich action takes the following parameters: . | URL – the URL of the enriching API. | Payload – comma-separated list of vocabulary keys to send to the API. | Vocabulary Prefix – the vocabulary prefix used to save properties returned by the API. | . When the Enrich action is invoked, it sends the payload to the API (HTTP POST) and saves the returned properties with the specified vocabulary prefix.

Example of custom export target . One of the examples of custom export targets is Kafka. It provides an efficient way to export golden records from CluedIn to Kafka. The Kafka connector requires the following parameters: . | Bootstrap Servers – Kafka server address. | SASL Username – the username or the key. | SASL Password – the secret or the password. | . When you start the stream with the Kafka connector, CluedIn first checks if the connection can be established. Then, CluedIn checks for the streaming mode—event mode or synchronized—that is used in the particular export target configuration.

    "content": "If you read our article on how to approach a data project in CluedIn, you already know the importance of starting small. Here are additional recommendations for preparing your first use cases: . | Priority 1: Few Records – select use cases that involve a small number of records. | Priority 2: Easy – choose something straightforward to implement. | Priority 3: Impact – ensure the use case creates noticeable value. | . Your initial use cases do not have to be the highest priority tasks but should be significant enough to demonstrate value. Successfully implementing these small use cases will help your team build confidence in your approach, processes, and tools. Use these early successes to demonstrate your team’s ability to deliver results and highlight CluedIn’s effectiveness to stakeholders. Once that is done, scale up gradually, and begin tackling your more substantial, real-world use cases. You can ingest millions of records into CluedIn, so you don’t have to worry about the load. Instead, think about business domains, rules, and what you want to produce. After that, the next natural step might involve processing all records or integrating one more source. This process will help you find balance between time and value. Aim to clean, deduplicate, enrich, and process smaller subsets of data thoroughly rather than handling massive datasets with minimal processing. Embrace a pragmatic approach by adapting to reality. Understand that sometimes compromises are necessary. You might not be able to enrich or deduplicate all data immediately, and that’s acceptable. CluedIn’s experience and support will help you find this balance to implement a successful project. ",

The following table lists the most important mapping terms, their purposes, and links to relevant documentation. | Name | Purpose | Link to documentation | . | Business domain | The business domain represents a specific business object that describes the semantic meaning of your data.

In terms of medallion architecture, a clue is a silver record. To get a good default mapping configuration, use the auto-mapping option. It is a great way to start and define the most important mapping attributes—business domain and vocabulary. You can learn more about the process of creating mapping and find step-by-step instructions in a dedicated article. For lineage purposes, we recommend keeping a vocabulary close to the source. Later, you can map the vocabulary keys to generic, shared vocabulary keys. When you have multiple sources with vocabulary keys mapped directly to the generic, shared vocabulary keys, it can become overwhelming to have more than 10 sources mapping directly to your golden records. In order to avoid confusion for those consuming the records, it is a good practice to map to the source vocabulary first. ",

    "title": "Setting up the right identifiers",
    "content": "After you selected the right business domain and vocabulary, it’s time to choose the right key to produce the identifiers for your records. Poorly defined identifiers can have a truly unexpected impact. The most common pitfall of poorly defined identifiers is what we call over-merging. It happens when you set up an identifier that is not actually unique. Suppose you choose the country code as a key, then all records with the same country code will merge together into one record. For example, if you have 100,000 records with the country code of “DK”, then all those 100,000 records will end up as 1 record. Poorly defined identifiers can cause system slowdowns. While reverting is possible, it will take time as now CluedIn will need to split those records. At that point, the fastest solution is to remove those records from CluedIn and restart the mapping. With the country code example, it is easy to understand that using non-unique properties as identifiers is not a good choice. Sometimes, the key you consider unique is not in fact unique. For example, a SKU code—unique internal product code—can have the following issues: . | - as a value. | NULL as a text value. | N/A, N-A, or any other combinations. | Records sharing the same code, even if it is supposed to be unique. | Wrong value (for example, email in place of the actual value). | . Of course, CluedIn has ways to fix such data quality issues. However, if you blindly choose a key to produce an identifier, it may lead to issues. To avoid this, CluedIn tells you the potential duplicates you have in your records before processing. ",

The data quality virtuous cycle is a concept that emphasizes the continuous improvement of data quality through an iterative process of: . | Data ingestion – upload the data from the source systems into CluedIn and then map and process it to produce golden records. | Data transformation – identify and correct any issues in your data with the help of clean projects, establish criteria for finding and eliminating duplicates. | Data automation – create business rules to apply data transformations, capture data quality issues, and determine operational values. | Data export – send ready-to-use data from CluedIn to the external systems (also known as landing zones) where you usually perform tasks with business data. | Release to production – when all of the above steps are working as intended, release your first use case to production, and start with the next one. | .

A billable record is a new record that was processed from a data source. Learn more about billable records in a dedicated article. What record is considered a new record? . A new record is a unique record that comes from a source of data and is processed in CluedIn. If you repeatedly send the exact same record within the same source, it won’t be added to your billable records count. Each time CluedIn processes records, it keeps a hash code that represents the record. As some source systems do not support deltas, we do not want you to have your billable records increased due to this shortcoming. So, if the record within a source has the exact same hash code (same collection of attribute/value), it won’t be added to the billable records count. Keep in mind that changing the mapping can change the hash code of records, leading to those records being counted as new billable records. However, if you remove records from CluedIn, the number of billable records will decrease. So, if you require a major change in your mapping, make sure you remove the records you want to change to avoid having an increase in billable records. ",

Generally, you should use the above-mentioned options to normalize or denormalize values in the records before they become golden records. Even though CluedIn is a tool to fix data quality issues, it can be useful to do some preparation before processing. This ensures that the advanced mapping code and rules remain close to the source and run only on the source records. If the records were already processed, the same activity would run on a large set of golden records. Therefore, if an issue appears only in a specific source, then it is a good idea to fix it with pre-processing rules, as the manipulation would be specific to that source.

This way you can verify that the golden records are accurate and then switch to automated processing.

    "title": "Main aspects of IT journey",
    "content": "There are several aspects of the IT journey that you should consider in order to configure CluedIn according to your business needs. The primary aspect is authentication and authorization to ensure that only legitimate users can access the system. Your business data typically resides in various sources, such as databases, ERP systems, CRM systems, and other applications. One of the key tasks in CluedIn is data ingestion, which requires establishing connections to these data sources. Additionally, to enrich your data with information from third-party sources, you can connect to the appropriate enrichers. Finally, to share ready-to-use data, CluedIn must connect to the external systems of your choice, often referred to as landing zones. All these tasks are part of the IT journey. In this section, you’ll find recommendations for the starting points of each aspect of the IT journey. Authentication and authorization . Establish the groundwork based on the rules of your IT organization. You will likely need to use your single sign-on (SSO) systems and roles in CluedIn. If you are starting with the development environment, perhaps SSO is not needed for it. If it is, CluedIn can assist, but always try to minimize steps to get started on your project. Connection to the sources . For your first use case, CluedIn will likely need to connect to the source. This generally involves IT steps managed by the system administrator. Here are some scenarios that explain the actions to take for different levels of access to the source: . | Full API access – discuss next steps with your CluedIn expert. | File export access – if full access is not possible, but you can get an export file, use that file. | No access – if you can’t get access, ask for the shape of the data and fake it. If you can’t even get this, escalate. Data is the fuel of your data transformation journey. CluedIn has encountered these situations many times, so let us know if you need help. | . Connection to enrichers . Enrichers are slightly more challenging because we can’t really fake them. You either have access or you don’t. If you don’t have access to one enricher, try another provided by CluedIn that doesn’t rely on IT (for example, Libpostal). It is important to see enrichers in action for a value perspective. It’s like having free, quality data at your disposal. But if you can’t access enrichers now, don’t wait and move forward. CluedIn is an agile platform, and you can always revisit this later. Connection to export targets . As a CluedIn user, you’ll want to share your improved data with other systems or places in your organization. To do this automatically, you’ll want to export directly to another source. As with any IT integration, you’ll need an owner ready to receive the data. If you face resistance or are blocked, there’s a trick: you can stream into the CluedIn database directly. This exercise proves that you are streaming the data to external destination. After all, it is better to have one stream than no stream. This will help you understand the kind of data you’re sending and the pace. ",

As a best practice, it is recommended to schedule installations earlier in the week (Tuesday–Thursday) to allow time for monitoring, troubleshooting, and stabilization. The CluedIn PaaS IT journey timeline depends on two aspects: . | Privilege – this refers to the access level you have in the given resource group where CluedIn is installed (read-only, partial edit, full edit). | Access to resource – this refers to your access for connecting to the CluedIn cluster (you can connect, you can connect but require an approval, or you can’t connect and someone has to give access to CluedIn cluster). | . Based on your privileges and access to the resource group, there can be 3 IT journey scenarios: . | CluedIn PaaS managed service – with high privilege and access to the resource group, the installation and IT journey might take days. | CluedIn PaaS managed instance – with high privilege but limited access to the resource group, the installation and IT journey might take weeks. | CluedIn PaaS self-hosted – with no privilege and no access to the resource group, the installation and IT journey might take months. | . Installation in a restrictive environment . The entire IT journey can be smooth and easy, but it will depend on your IT infrastructure and the policies in place. Since CluedIn requires connections to various external systems and sources, you may need to take additional steps during IT journey. If your infrastructure is restrictive, you might face problems related to network restrictions, private and service endpoints, custom DNS settings, firewall policies, token expiration, and so on. If this is your case, we might have to work with you on the following tasks to set up the foundational infrastructure: . | Creation of a Virtual Network (VNet) with 2 subnets: . | AKS subnet – dedicated subnet for AKS resources. | Delegated subnet for CI – subnet specifically delegated for Container Instance (CI) operations. | . | Configuration of service endpoints for secure access to storage account and key vault. | Enabling the routing table and network security groups (NSGs) for network management and enhanced security. | Creation of user identity to manage access and permissions across the infrastructure. | . Depending on your security and infrastructure policies, we might have to implement some of the following changes: . | Remove automatic creation and assignment of user identities from the publisher onboard module to streamline security management. | Disable the setup of a private DNS zone in the storage account. | Configure the storage account and the key vault to use only private endpoints. | Other changes might be required to comply with your security and infrastructure policies. | . Additionally, your Azure administrator might be required to perform the following tasks to support infrastructure provisioning: . | Role assignments: . | Assign the Owner role to manage resources. | Assign the Storage File Data Contributor role at the storage account to manage file-level permissions. | Assign the Key Vault Administrator role to the user identity to enable Key Vault management and secret handling. | . | Private DNS Zone Vnet Link: . | Virtual network link enabled for privatelink.file.core.windows.net . | Virtual network link enabled for privatelink.blob.core.windows.net . | Virtual network link enabled for privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net . | . | .

In this playbook, you will learn how to organize your MDM project and communicate its complexities and associated risks to your managers and business stakeholders. By understanding these elements, you’ll be better equipped to: . | Deliver value by improving critical data and demonstrate project progress to stakeholders. Delivering value does not mean using all CluedIn features; it means having one end-to-end data flow running in CluedIn that has improved value. | Mitigate potential issues and ensure project success. | . The data ingestion process consists of several steps: data impact workshop, picking the right tool, ingesting, mapping, and processing. Before diving into the process of ingesting data into CluedIn, we recommend that you get acquainted with the foundational principles outlined in this playbook. In our experience, we’ve observed that many data teams tend to jump directly into the implementation phase without fully understanding the specificity of CluedIn. Additionally, they often overlook the critical step of defining which data will have the most significant impact on their objectives. If you have a small data team (one or two people), you may opt for a lighter approach. However, we still recommend following the guidelines from this playbook to better structure your MDM project. Main data ingestion principle for your first use case . If you have the opportunity, focus on the critical data you have access to and start with a simple implementation. Once completed, organize a demo for your stakeholders and then release it to your production environment. Why should you apply this principle? . | Improved data – you have one end-to-end data flow that improves a portion of your critical data. | Available in production – you went through your IT processes to deploy the production environment according to your organization policies. It means that from now on, it will only get easier. | Full cycle of data journey – by delivering a fairly simple use case into production, you’ve completed one full cycle of your MDM project, which you’ll need to repeat every time. | . Where to start with data ingestion? The first step of data ingestion is the data impact workshop. It is a collaborative session designed to help you identify your business domains, determine the data sources to ingest, and assess their criticality to your operations.

    "content": "| Audience | Time to read | . | Data Steward | 4 minutes | . You are here in the data journey . Now that you have completed the data ingestion process and generated some golden records, it is time to start improving the quality of these records during data transformation. The data transformation process consists of three aspects: . | Improving the quality of values with the help of clean projects. | Decreasing the number of duplicates with the help of deduplication projects. | Extending the quality with values coming from trusted sources with the help of enrichers. | . The sequence of data transformation activities is flexible. You can start with data cleaning, then move to deduplication, and finally to enrichment. Alternatively, you can start with deduplication, then clean the data, and add enrichers last. The choice is yours as CluedIn doesn’t impose a strict order of data transformation activities. In this playbook, we will provide the details for each data transformation aspect. However, before diving into specifics, familiarize yourself with the key terms and features that will be useful during data transformation in CluedIn: . | Golden record . | Saved search . | Glossary term . | . For a smooth start of your data transformation journey in CluedIn, learn how to leverage saved search and glossary. Both of these tools help you identify a specific set of golden records for data transformation. However, each tool has its specific practical application. Why is saved search important for data transformation? . Saved search gives you an easy way to review golden records that match complex filters. Once you define the filters and add the needed vocabulary keys to the search page, you can save the current search configuration for future use. Next time when you need to review a specific set of golden records and their vocabulary keys, you can quickly open a saved search instead of configuring the search from scratch. That’s why saved search is a great tool for your day-to-day data transformation activities. Saved search can be personal (visible only for you) or shared (visible to your team members). If you want others to review a specific set of golden records, make sure you create a shared saved search. In addition to reviewing golden records, saved search is useful for creating clean projects. When you make a decision on which golden records you want to clean, you can register this decision in a saved search. This way you can quickly create a clean project and verify the results of your cleaning activities. Let’s consider an example of golden records that contain misspelled job titles. When configuring the search filters, you can list all misspelled values for the Job Title property. As a result, you will see all golden records that contain misspelled job titles. To be able to identify data quality issues at a glance, you can customize the search results page by adding or removing the columns (properties or vocabulary keys). When you reach the desired view of golden records on the search results page, it is time to save the current search configuration. After you retrieve the saved search, you can create a clean project in just a few clicks—the properties will be taken directly from the saved search. Another advantage is that you can quickly verify the results of your cleaning activities—simply open the saved search and if there are no results, it means that all data quality issues have been fixed. Why is glossary important for data transformation? . While glossary is similar to the saved search in terms of reviewing golden records that match complex filters, it gives you an additional advantage of documenting your golden records. It means that you can add descriptions, tags, ratings, and certification levels to the glossary term. All of these elements make it easier for your colleagues to understand: . | What golden records are included in the glossary term. | What you are trying to achieve with a specific collection of golden records. | What data transformation activities you have performed on a specific collection of golden records. | . Glossary can be used in filters in several places in CluedIn: search, clean projects, deduplication projects, and streams. Essentially, you can create a glossary with a specific set of golden records, then perform various data transformation activities on those golden records, and finally send ready-to-use and well-documented golden records to external systems. That’s why glossary is especially useful in in data-sharing activities—you can set up a stream with a specific glossary to send well-documented golden records to external systems. Where to start with data transformation? . Start by identifying a set of golden records that should be transformed. Register those golden records along with specific vocabulary keys using a saved search or glossary. As the order of data transformation activities is flexible, we suggest starting with clean projects. ",

This will deploy some additional pods to each available node. Once the add-on has been deployed, it will create a key vault managed identity that is used to communicate back to the AKV from the Kubernetes cluster. | To get the managed identity, run the following. $params = @( '--name', $aks.name '--resource-group', $aks.resourceGroup '--subscription', $subscription '--query', 'addonProfiles.azureKeyvaultSecretsProvider.identity.objectId' '--output', 'tsv' ) $kvManagedIdentity = az aks show @params . Depending on if you’re using RBAC or Key Vault access policy, you will need to update the appropriate area so the key vault managed identity can GET and LIST secrets and certificates. | Obtain the key vault details. $kv = az keyvault show --name $keyVaultName --resource-group $keyVaultRG | ConvertFrom-Json . This guide assumes you’ll use the pre-existing key vault deployed at install time. You may use an alternative key vault if preferred. In this case, update the values above to match your desired key vault. | Update access to your key vault. | RBAC $params = @( '--assignee', $kvManagedIdentity '--role', 'Key Vault Secret User' '--role', 'Key Vault Certificate User' '--scope', $kv.id ) az role assignment create @params . | Policy $params = @( '--name', $kv.name '--resource-group', $kv.resourceGroup '--certificate-permissions', 'get' '--secret-permissions', 'get' '--spn', $kvManagedIdentity ) az keyvault set-policy @params . | . With the above now set, it’s time to start uploading your secrets and certificates. | Navigate to the Key Vault in the Azure Portal instance and begin adding secrets and certificates. Depending on what you are uploading, select either Certificates or Secrets. | For Certificates: Upload a PFX of your choice along with a password. | For Secrets: Create a secret key:value pair. These will be used for synchronization from AKV to Kubernetes secrets. As Kubernetes secrets are an oject that contain multiple key:value pairs, ensure that your naming convention in AKV makes sense. | . Example: In Kubernetes, we may have a secret cluedin-login-details which contains 2 key:value pairs: Username, and Password. In AKV, it would be best to have these two secrets as cluedin-login-username and cluedin-login-password. When we get later into the guide, we’ll explain how to pair these back up into a single object. | With all your desired secrets and certificates now uploaded to AKV, it’s time to configure the Values.yaml to begin synchronizing. In your values file, add the following block of code into the global values: . global: keyvault: enabled: true # When enabled, it will deploy the secret store manifest to Kubernetes #frontendCrt: cluedin-sample-pfx # This must match the certificate name on the AKV end. When mounted, it will appear as `cluedin-frontend-crt` userAssignedIdentityID: $kvManagedIdentity # This is the guid for the kv managed identity keyvaultName: $kv.name # This is your key vault name tenantId: $tenantId # This is the guid of your tenant secretProviderClasses: cluedin-server: # For every key under `secretProviderClasses`, a new secret provider class will be created with the same name and `-sync` appended - secretName: cluedin-login-details # This is how the secret will appear within Kubernetes Secrets once synchronized secretType: # [OPTIONAL] Defaults to Opaque. But you can specify any supported secretType secretKeys: password: cluedin-login-password # The left side (Key) is the name in the Kubernetes secret object. The right side (Value) is the AKV reference which will grab its value username: cluedin-login-username infrastructure: cert-manager: #enabled: false # Only set to false if using an uploaded frontend certificate . If you are using the certificate upload as part of your setup, you must disable cert-manager by setting enabled: false. You also must set frontendCrt to a value. It will be mounted as cluedin-frontend-crt on cluedin-server. This secret name cannot change. | With all the secrets and certificates now done, the last step is to mount, map, and synchronize the secrets to Kubernetes. For every key under secretProviderClass, a new secret provider will be created with the same name with -sync appended. This gives you the flexibility to have secrets to share the same life cycle as an application, or to use a singular pod to synchronize the secrets. cluedin-server is the only server that will automount if keys are specified under the cluedin-server secretProviderClasses section. For everything else, a specific mount point will be required along with preventing local password creation by using the appropriate key. We highly recommend having secrets share life cycles with the application. We will cover only this scenario below. Please see the mapping table below. | Application | Secret | Helm Path | Mount Point | . | cluedin-server | cluedin-admin-secret | application.bootstrap.organization.existingSecret | auto-mounts | . |   | cluedin-email | application.email.secretRef |   | . |   | cluedin-frontend-crt | global.keyvault.frontendCrt |   | . | cluedin-sqlserver | cluedin-sqlserver-secret | infrastructure.mssql.existingSecret | infrastructure.mssql.extraVolumesinfrastructure.mssql.extraVolumeMounts | . |   | cluedin-sqlserver-clientuser-secret | application.sqlserver.users.clientUser.existingSecret |   | . | cluedin-elasticsearch | elasticsearch-credentials | infrastructure.elasticsearch.auth.existingSecret | infrastructure.elasticsearch.extraVolumesinfrastructure.elasticsearch.extraVolumeMounts | . | cluedin-redis | cluedin-redis | infrastructure.redis.auth.existingSecret | infrastructure.redis.master.extraVolumesinfrastructure.redis.master.extraVolumeMounts | . | cluedin-neo4j | cluedin-neo4j-secrets | infrastructure.neo4j.neo4j.passwordFromSecret | infrastructure.neo4j.additionalVolumesinfrastructure.neo4j.additionalVolumeMounts | . |   | cluedin-neo4j-auth | !! shared from above !! |   | . | cluedin-grafana | cluedin-grafana | infrastructure.monitoring.grafana.admin.existingSecret | infrastructure.monitoring.grafana.extraContainerVolumesinfrastructure.monitoring.grafana.sidecar.dashboards.extraMounts | . | cluedin-rabbitmq | cluedin-rabbitmq | infrastructure.rabbitmq.auth.existingPasswordSecret | infrastructure.rabbitmq.extraVolumesinfrastructure.rabbitmq.extraVolumeMounts | . |   | cluedin-rabbitmq-load-definition | !! shared from above !! |   | .

This deploys some additional pods to each node to facilitate this. However, if your max pods limit is the default 30, you may run into an issue after deploying as the CluedIn application is on the borderline of this value. Please ensure this is checked before proceeding as it may cause the cluster to not function correctly. | The way the secrets are synchronized is by using the cluedin-server pod mounting the secret store or mapping and mounting on other pods. The sample file and table above explain how to achieve this. It’s important to note that the secrets synchronize only when the pod is active. It doesn’t need to be in a running state, but it must at least be pending. This is a limitation of the CSI driver itself rather than the solution provided by CluedIn. | The secrets synchronized do not overwrite existing secrets that are created by the CluedIn Installer. If your secret matches the same name (front-end certificate is mandatory here), you must remove the existing secret for the synchronized secret to take over. | Please ensure that you have enough resources. For example, by default the Neo4j and Elasticsearch pods consume a majority of the nodes they have been assigned. Having the additional Key Vault pods on these nodes may potentially prevent these from starting up even though the Key Vault pods request very little resource. | . ",

    "content": "This section will explain some of the known issues. Issue 1 . Problem: When doing a migration of RabbitMQ from local kubernetes password to a synced password, you must do a sequence of steps due to the RabbitMQ charts logic. Solution: . | Do an initial deployment where the secret is mounted and mapped to RabbitMQ pod as well as the initial password being supplied in the User Supply Values for RabbitMQ. | Once deployed and you can see the secretProviderClass, delete the existing rabbitMQ secrets and then kill the RabbitMQ pod. A new pod should spawn and the secrets should then be mapped to the secretProviderClass. | Update User Supply Values to remove the password and update it to use an existing one. Redeploy the config, and this time it should succeed as the sychronised secret will exist at deployment time. | . Note: This is only an issue with migration. Fresh installs do not have this issue. Issue 2 . Problem: Not all secrets work from a synced source. Solution: Unfortunately, not all secrets will work from AKV. An example of this is the acr-registry-credentials secret. For a secret to be synchronized, it must first be mounted to a pod. However, you cannot pull the image for the pod if the secret does not exist. There are ways around this such as having a generic pod that is deployed pre-helm install, but this is not a scenario we support. ",

If it’s not possible to have this role, you need to ask someone with enough permissions to create an AKS cluster. When you create a new AKS cluster in a particular resource group, Microsoft Azure automatically creates an infrastructure resource group (with “MC_” prefix) to keep AKS-related resources: disks, public IP, identity, etc. Therefore, you should have enough permissions to create resource groups in a given subscription to create a cluster.

    "content": "Let’s explore the concept of deduplication in CluedIn through an example. We have three duplicate records—Person 1, Person 2, and Person 3. How do we merge these three records into a single, consolidated golden record? . Note that the email is the same for Person 1 and Person 2, but different for Person 3. To begin with, we need to set up matching rules in the deduplication project: one rule to check for the same email and the other rule to check for the same first name and last name. Records meeting the criteria of either the first or second rule will be selected as possible duplicates. When you generate matches in the deduplication project, Person 1 and Person 2 are selected as possible duplicates because they have the same email address. At this point, the second rule did not identify any duplicates because the three records have different first and last names. When reviewing the group of duplicates, you have to choose the appropriate values among conflicting values. In this case, the conflicting values would be first name and last name. After merging, the duplicates result in a merged golden record—Merged Person 1 and 2—which combines consolidated and complete information. Merging does not create a new golden record; instead, it uses one of the duplicate records as a base and aggregates data from the others to form a comprehensive golden record. Now, after the first run of the deduplication project, we have two duplicate records: Merged Person 1 and 2 and Person 3. When a merged golden record appears, the rules that led to the merge need to be re-evaluated. It means that you need to generate matches in the deduplication project again. This time, the second rule comes into play: Merged Person 1 and 2 and Person 3 are selected as possible duplicates because they have the same first and last names. However, the email is identified as a conflicting value, so you have to choose the appropriate email for the merged golden record. After merging, the duplicates result in a merged golden record—Merged Person 1, 2, 3—with consolidated and complete information. Every time golden records are merged, it is crucial to re-evaluate them, as they may contain new information. This new information may align with criteria from matching rules, potentially making golden records eligible for subsequent merges. Essentially, each merging operation has the potential to produce golden records that could initiate further iterations of the merging process. This is why deduplication can be a somewhat time-consuming process, requiring multiple runs until no duplicates are identified, ensuring a comprehensive consolidation of data. ",

    "content": "The following diagram illustrates the place of enricher within the data life cycle in CluedIn. From golden record to enricher . To begin the process of enriching a golden record with additional information, you need to designate a vocabulary key. This vocabulary key serves as the basis for retrieving additional information about that particular golden record from the internet. If you don’t provide a vocabulary key, the enricher won’t be able to look for additional information. For more details about prerequisites for an enricher, see Connectors. From enricher to clue . When the enricher receives the vocabulary key value, it calls an external internet service, typically an API, to retrieve additional information associated with the specified vocabulary key. Then, the information obtained from the external service appears in CluedIn as a clue. For more information about the clue structure, see Clue reference. Now, how do we link a new clue to the golden record? . From clue to golden record . When a new clue appears in CluedIn from the enricher, it goes into the processing pipeline. It is important to note that such clue has the same primary identifier as the golden record. During processing, CluedIn transforms the clue into a data part and executes merging by identifiers to ensure that the new information seamlessly integrates with the existing golden record. To learn more about what happens to the clue during processing, see Data life cycle. The processing of a clue from an enricher follows the same steps as any other clue within the system. ",

    "content": "Let’s explore the concept of hierarchy through an example of Organization-Project-Employee relations. How can we visualize those relations in a hierarchy? . To begin, we need to create a hierarchy for the /Organization business domain. Because some organizations might be connected with others through parent-child relations, we select the corresponding edge type (/Parent). For convenience, we create multiple single-root projects, where each top-level root has its own hierarchy. As a result, two hierarchy projects are generated. We are going to use one of them to illustrate project and employee relations within an organization. Now, we need to visualize the relations between projects within organizations. However, as for now, only organizations are available in the hierarchy project. To load more golden records from other business domains, we need to edit the hierarchy properties and remove the /Organization business domain. Now, all golden records are available for selection, so we can load golden records that are connected to the organization by the specific type of relation (/PartOf). The next step is to add the employees who work on specific projects. To do that, we can load golden records that are connected to projects by the specific type of relation (/WorksFor). As a result, we leveraged the existing relations between golden records to visualize the connections between employees and projects within organizations. Following this approach, you can build complex hierarchies to discover hidden value from any data source. ",

Data part rules are mostly used for normalization and transformation of values on the vocabulary key level. | Triggering the enrichment – to improve the clues by providing additional details from external services. | Merging identical clues by identifiers – to reduce the number of duplicates in the system by merging clues that have identical primary identifiers or additional identifiers. For more information, see Identifiers. | . During golden record processing, CluedIn analyzed a data part and determines whether it will produce a new golden record or aggregate into the existing golden record.

This article provides a high-level overview of the available disaster recovery options for the CluedIn PaaS instance. The purpose of this article is to help you understand the available disaster recovery options so you can choose the one that best meets your needs. Depending on your agreement with CluedIn and your IT policy, the disaster recovery option that you choose can be managed either by CluedIn or by yourself. If you need to customize the selected option, additional costs may occur on the services side. In case of any questions, contact our support team at support@cluedin.com. To begin with, it is important to emphasize that each CluedIn PaaS instance is fully isolated, both in terms of clusters and networks. This means that each instance operates within its own dedicated Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster located in the specific Azure region. Keep in mind that your CluedIn cluster is set up with high availability (HA) by default, ensuring it remains operational even if some components fail. This means that critical pods are replicated—if one pod fails, the other one is ready to take over. These critical pods include cluedin-server-processing, cluedin-datasource-processing, cluedin-gql, cluedin-server, and cluedin-ui. So, you don’t need to implement high availability on top of the cluster. CluedIn PaaS uses the standard tier for AKS cluster management. This means that AKS cluster is guaranteed to be operational and available more than 99% of time. For more information about uptime SLA for AKS cluster management, see Microsoft documentation. ",

The Libpostal enricher has its pros and cons, which can help you decide if it will solve your use case. Pros of Libpostal: . | It is open source and free to use, with no licensing costs. | It is great at parsing and address standardization. | It supports multiple languages and address formats. | . Cons of Libpostal: . | It lacks advanced enrichment features, thereby returning fewer details. | It may experience performance issues when processing large volumes of data. | . Example of using Libpostal . Let’s consider an example of a CluedIn golden record that contains the address property. This property includes street address details all in one value. To ensure data accuracy and usability, we will use the Libpostal enricher to validate and parse this address. To configure the Libpostal enricher, specify the business domain of golden records that you want to enrich and the vocabulary key that contains the initial address.

    "title": "Day‑by‑Day Guide",
    "content": "Day 1 — Define the thin slice and “data out” first . Objectives . | Pick one concrete question you want to answer or workflow to power. | Define the Export Target and format: table, topic, API, or file layout. | Identify one source (asset) that supports the outcome, even if imperfect. | . Artifacts . | Use‑case brief (1 page): purpose, users, downstream surface, SLAs. | Data contract (minimal) for the export: the final fields and semantics. | Runbook skeleton (who owns what, escalation, observability). | . Tip: If the export is a table, decide primary key, update strategy (upsert vs. append), and schema evolution policy now. Day 2 — Create Ingestion Endpoints (stream or batch) . Objectives . | Create an Ingestion Endpoint for one asset, using a streaming or scheduled path: . | Streaming: Kafka topic / webhook that produces JSON lines | Batch: S3/Blob folder with daily/hourly drops (CSV/JSON/Parquet) | . | . Example: HTTP ingestion (webhook) . curl -X POST \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer &lt;CLUEDIN_API_KEY&gt;\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"source\":\"crm-contacts\",\"payload\":{\"id\":\"c_123\",\"email\":\"a@example.com\",\"first_name\":\"Ada\",\"last_name\":\"Lovelace\",\"updated_at\":\"2025-08-22T12:00:00Z\"}}' \\ https://&lt;YOUR_INGESTION_ENDPOINT_URL&gt;/ingest . Example: S3/Blob batch registration (pseudo‑JSON) . { \"name\": \"s3-sales-orders\", \"type\": \"s3-bucket-watch\", \"options\": { \"bucket\": \"acme-prod-orders\", \"prefix\": \"daily/\", \"file_types\": [\"json\",\"csv\",\"parquet\"], \"schedule\": \"cron(0 * * * ? *)\" // hourly } } . Checklist . | Endpoint created for a single asset | Producer (or object drop) automated | Authentication/authorization confirmed | Observability: ingestion success counter + dead‑letter path | . Rule: From here on, no manual uploads. Everything arrives via the endpoint. Day 3 — Land the first raw data “as‑is” . Objectives . | Send a small but real sample through the endpoint. | Verify CluedIn can parse and persist the records. | Capture lineage and metadata (source system, timestamps, version). | . Validation . | Ingestion dashboard shows new records | Sample record previewed (raw fields visible) | No pre‑cleaning done upstream | . Anti‑pattern: Don’t pause to cleanse/massage data before landing it. That’s what cleaning projects are for later this week. Day 4 — Minimal mapping v0 (don’t perfect it) . Objectives . | Create just‑enough entity mapping to recognize core entities (e.g., Person, Organization, Order) and a few relationships. | Avoid exotic field logic; capture IDs, names, keys, timestamps. | . Tactics . | Start with 5–10 high‑value fields only. | Mark known primary keys and foreign keys. | Add a default namespace for unmapped attributes. | . Success looks like . | Records appear as proper entities | Core joins/relationships visible | No blocking errors preventing export | . Remember: You will change this mapping many times. That’s normal. Day 5 — Wire up Export Targets v0 . Objectives . | Create the first export to your chosen destination (warehouse table, topic, API, file). Aim for a stable daily/hourly schedule. | . Example: table export config (pseudo‑JSON) . { \"name\": \"warehouse-contacts-v0\", \"type\": \"sql-table\", \"options\": { \"connection\": \"analytics-warehouse\", \"schema\": \"mdm\", \"table\": \"contacts_v0\", \"mode\": \"upsert\", \"primary_key\": [\"contact_id\"] }, \"mapping\": { \"contact_id\": \"Person.id\", \"email\": \"Person.email\", \"first_name\": \"Person.first_name\", \"last_name\": \"Person.last_name\", \"updated_at\": \"Person.updated_at\" }, \"schedule\": \"0 * * * *\" // hourly } . Validation . | Export task succeeds end‑to‑end | Downstream surface can query/use the output | Row counts within expected bounds | . Day 6 — End‑to‑end smoke test on a schedule . Objectives . | Run the pipeline in → through → out a few times on an automatic schedule. | Add alerts for failures and volume anomalies (±X% vs baseline). | . Checklist . | End‑to‑end schedule in place | Alerting/notifications configured | Runbook updated with failure modes and triage steps | . Day 7 — Retrospective &amp; Week‑2 plan . Discuss (30–45 min) . | What slowed us down? | What parts of mapping are confusing downstream? | Which fields are most error‑prone? | What small fixes would materially improve trust? | . Plan . | Pick 3–5 fixes for Week 2 (AI Agents, cleaning, metrics, dedup). | Nominate owners and define “done” for each. | . Day 8 — Use AI Agents to analyze data quality . Objectives . | Run AI Agents to scan entities for: . | Missingness, invalid formats, out‑of‑range values | Suggested validations (e.g., regex, domain lists, referential checks) | Duplicate candidates (e.g., person/org dedup) | . | . Workflow . | Run an analysis prompt or playbook against your entity set. | Review the findings list with counts and examples. | Accept or tailor proposed validation rules and dedup hints. | Open issues/tasks directly from findings. | . Deliverables . | Findings doc with top 5 issues | Proposed validation rules drafted | Candidate dedup keys identified | . Day 9 — Create cleaning projects (incremental fixes) . Objectives . | Build cleaning projects that remediate the top issues. Examples: . | Standardize phone/email formats | Trim/normalize names | Resolve country/state codes | Impute defaults (only where safe) | Enforce referential integrity | . | . Practices . | Small, re-runnable steps | Idempotent logic (safe to run multiple times) | Versioned transformations; review &amp; rollback friendly | Scheduled execution (hourly/daily) | . Success . | Cleaning pipeline runs on a cadence | Changes land back in CluedIn entities | No breaking changes to the export schema | . Day 10 — Establish data quality metrics &amp; alerts . Objectives . | Define and baseline key metrics for your use case: . | Completeness (non‑null %, required fields) | Validity (regex/domain compliance) | Uniqueness (duplicate rate) | Consistency (cross‑field rules) | Timeliness (SLA latency from source → export) | . | . Actions . | Capture baselines per entity/table. | Configure thresholds and alerts. | Add a dashboard panel to your downstream surface. | . Rule of thumb . | Improve by small increments frequently (e.g., +0.5–1.0% per day). | . Day 11 — Iterate on mapping (practice change/revert) . Objectives . | Evolve mapping to add fields demanded by downstream users. | Practice safe change: . | Branch/version your mapping | Apply change to a staging export | Compare outputs (row count, nulls, schema drift) | Promote or revert | . | . Checklist . | Version history for mapping changes | Staging export used for trials | Rollback tested at least once | . Day 12 — Set up deduplication projects . Objectives . | Create dedup projects for key entities (Person/Organization) with a deterministic first pass. | Auto‑approve only high‑confidence matches; queue the rest for review. | . Example deterministic rules (pseudo) . rules: - name: exact_email when: lower(email) matches lower(other.email) confidence: 0.98 - name: phone_e164 when: e164(phone) == e164(other.phone) confidence: 0.95 - name: org_name_address when: norm(name)==norm(other.name) and norm(addr)==norm(other.addr) confidence: 0.92 auto_approve_threshold: 0.97 queue_threshold: 0.85 . Success . | High‑confidence duplicates auto‑merged or flagged for auto‑action | Reviewer queue created for the “gray area” | Export logic updated to respect master records | . Day 13 — Add a second asset, adapt the model . Objectives . | Onboard the second source that enriches the same entities or introduces a related one. | Validate that mapping, cleaning, and dedup logic still holds. | . Regression checks . | Row counts within expected bounds | DQ metrics didn’t regress | Export schema unchanged (or managed evolution with version bump) | . Day 14 — Go‑live checklist &amp; handover . Go‑live gates . | End‑to‑end schedule stable for 3 consecutive runs | Alerts firing to the right channel with owners | DQ metrics tracked and improving | Dedup auto‑approve threshold validated | Runbook complete (how to pause/retry/backfill; RTO/RPO notes) | Ownership clear: source, mapping, cleaning, export | . Handover packet . | Use‑case brief, data contract, runbook, dashboard link, “what changed” log, next 30/60/90 roadmap. | . ",

In CluedIn → Admin → Authentication . &lt;!-- Paste IdP Metadata --&gt; &lt;EntityDescriptor entityID=\"https://idp.example.com/metadata\"&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/EntityDescriptor&gt; . { \"type\": \"saml2\", \"acs_url\": \"https://&lt;your-cluedin-host&gt;/auth/saml/acs\", \"entity_id\": \"https://&lt;your-cluedin-host&gt;/auth/saml/metadata\", \"email_attribute\": \"email\", \"groups_attribute\": \"memberOf\", \"enforce_sso_only\": true } . 1.3 Group-to-Role Mapping . Map IdP groups to CluedIn roles. Keep mappings in code/config for repeatability. # cluedin-role-mapping.yaml mappings: - idp_group: \"cluedin-admins\" roles: [\"Administrator\"] - idp_group: \"cluedin-data-engineers\" roles: [\"Data Engineer\"] - idp_group: \"cluedin-stewards\" roles: [\"Data Steward\"] - idp_group: \"cluedin-viewers\" roles: [\"Viewer\"] defaults: # Users with SSO but no mapped group get these roles (or none) roles: [\"Viewer\"] . Least privilege: give broad read where required, but restrict write/config permissions to a small, accountable set. 1.4 SCIM Provisioning (Optional) . Enable SCIM to automate user/group lifecycle: . | Create/Update/Deactivate users in CluedIn based on IdP. | Sync group membership so role mappings stay current. | . IdP → SCIM config (example) . { \"scim_base_url\": \"https://&lt;your-cluedin-host&gt;/scim/v2\", \"bearer_token\": \"&lt;SCIM_PROVISIONING_TOKEN&gt;\", \"sync_interval_minutes\": 15 } . Operational tips . | Treat SCIM like code: change via PR, audit regularly. | Test deprovisioning; confirm tokens and sessions are revoked. | . ",

You have two main patterns—pick one (or both): . 1) Scan exports that CluedIn writes to your lake/warehouse. | Register the storage/database in Purview. | Schedule scans so Purview catalogs the tables/files produced by CluedIn. | Pro: simple, no custom code. Con: lineage may be coarse. | . 2) Push lineage/metadata into Purview (Atlas-compatible APIs). | Use a job to publish processes/entities/lineage after your exports run. | Pro: explicit lineage from source → CluedIn → export.

Before proceeding with the getting started guides, make sure that you have CluedIn up and running. This step is essential to ensure that you can follow along seamlessly and fully experience the basic features. If you don’t have CluedIn installed, check the following guides: . | CluedIn SaaS Sign up . | CluedIn Private SaaS installation . | CluedIn PaaS installation . | Local installation of CluedIn . | . The guides in this section provide quick, hands-on instructions for the basic operations in CluedIn, such as: . | Ingesting the data into CluedIn. | Cleaning and deduplicating the records. | Streaming the records to a Microsoft SQL database. | Creating rules, hierarchies, glossary terms, and relations between golden records. | . While CluedIn contains a multitude of features, we’ll focus on these fundamental operations that are key to comprehending and using the platform. The primary objective of CluedIn is to empower you to customize the data flow according to your preferences, without imposing any strict rules and structures. That is why the sequence in which you choose to explore the guides within this section is flexible. However, we recommend starting by ingesting a file into CluedIn, as this will make it easier to view the outcomes from other record management operations, such as cleaning, deduplication, and streaming. CluedIn serves as a zero-modelling master data management platform, enabling you to immediately improve the quality of your data even before defining the approach for producing and sharing your golden records. After ingesting the data, you are free to perform other operations in any order you want. For instance, you may want to stream the records to a Microsoft SQL database. By doing so, you can promptly observe CluedIn’s ability to keep the stream synchronized with any actions performed on the records within the platform. Each getting-started guide includes a video and a set of step-by-step procedures designed to help you become acquainted with the basic features of CluedIn and acquire the skills for performing essential tasks.

To view the relations of a golden record . | Locate the golden record whose relations you want to view. Then, go to the Relations tab of the record. Here, you can view all the relations that the record has. As relations are added or removed, the information on the tab is updated accordingly. | Use levels to define how deeply you want to go in your graph. Consider this example: parent company – child company – department. When viewing the relations for the department record, levels work as follows: . | Level 1 – shows the relation between the department and the child company. | Level 2 – expands further to show the relations between the department, the child company, and the parent company. | . | Use filters to narrow down the information displayed in the graph: . | Direction – choose whether to display incoming, outgoing, or both types of relations. | Select which Business Domains and Relationship Types to include in the graph. | . | Configure Graph Display Settings: . | Include all directions – when this option is enabled, the graph will expand all direct relations of the neighbouring records. | Include Shadow Records – when this option is enabled, the graph will also show all shadow records associated with the golden records in it. This option may be useful when debugging relations between golden records. In the following example, the author of the Horizon Campaign Brief is a shadow record (Grace Patterson), and not a regular golden record. Shadow records are records that exist in CluedIn but are flagged as hidden. This typically happens when a record does not have enough values to be promoted to a golden record and contains only identifiers. | Include Temporal Relations – when this option is enabled, the graph will also show time-based connections between golden records. Temporal relations highlight how records are linked through events or periods in time: for example, showing that a person worked for a company, but only between 2015 and 2020. This option is useful when you need to understand not just how the records are related, but also when those relations existed. In the following example, the Marketing department record was added to CluedIn on September 10, 2025. On the same date, several more relations were created. | Include Enricher Data – when this option is enabled, the graph will also show records that consist only of data provided by enrichers. | . | Find and highlight specific nodes in the graph: . | To find records by their display name, on the settings panel on the left side of the page, enter the needed search keyword.

Power Automate can be integrated with CluedIn to capture important events in CluedIn and use them as triggers to start workflows. Such events include creating or modifying a vocabulary key, processing new records, inviting a new user, and more. When the workflow is started, it sends approval requests or notifications to the users in Outlook or the Approvals app in Teams. This way you can stay on top of certain processes in CluedIn, whether you are using the platform at the moment or not. The following image is example of approval request in Outlook. The following image shows an approval request in the Approvals app in Teams. Power Automate can be connected with CluedIn with the help of our CluedIn custom connector. This custom connector enables you to create workflows in the Power Automate widget in CluedIn. This means that even though you create workflows in CluedIn, technically they are created in Power Automate. The following screenshot shows an example of a workflow that is created in the Power Automate widget in CluedIn. The first and third actions of the workflow are provided by the CluedIn custom connector. The second action comes from the Approval connector, which is a standard Power Automate connector.

Property rules help you improve the quality of mapped records (clues) by normalizing and transforming property values. The difference between property rules and pre-process rules is that property rules are applied only to property values of the record while pre-process rules are applied to the whole record. So, if you want to apply some changes to the property values, create a property rule. Property rules are applied to the clues before pre-process rules and advanced mapping code. You can create property rules on you own or use the CluedIn AI recommendation engine to generate property rules. Prerequisites . To access property rules, go to Administration &gt; Feature Flags and make sure that the following features are enabled: . | Mapping Property Rules . | Data Set Quarantine . | . Create property rules on your own . You can apply the rule to all values of the property or define specific values. The available actions for the rule depend on the type of the property and are divided into several categories: . | Basic – set a new value (for example, you can enter a new value or use the value from another property) or write custom CEL expression. | Normalization – transform data into a consistent form. | Quarantine – send records to the quarantine where you can modify them and decide what to do with them afterwards. | . You can add multiple rules for one property. To create a property rule . | On the navigation pane, go to Integrations &gt; Data Sources. Then, find and open the data set. | Go to the Map tab, and then select Edit mapping. | On the Map columns to vocabulary key tab, find the property for which you need to create a rule, and then select Add property rule. | In Filter, select whether you want to apply the rule to all values or to specific values. | If you want to apply the rule to specific values: . | Select a condition to determine which values will be affected by the rule. | Select whether you want to apply the rule when the condition is met or when the condition is not met. For example, if you want to detect all invalid email addresses, select Is valid email address, and then select Apply action when condition is not met. | . | Select the Action that will be applied to the values of the property. | In the lower-right corner, select Add rule. The rule is added next to the property. The rule will be applied when you process the records. | . Create property rules using AI . CluedIn AI recommendation engine helps you create property rules in a quick and efficient manner. The engine analyzes properties and runs data type checks to come up with suggested actions.

    "content": "Let’s take a look at the example of using different rule types in the lifecycle of a golden record in CluedIn. Suppose you are receiving data about a company from various systems such as Salesforce, SAP, and MS SQL Server. Among other properties, the records from these systems include the countryCode property, which is used in the company golden record. However, the countryCode property contains inconsistent values—some country codes are in lower case and others in title case. To normalize these values, you can create a data part rule. After normalizing the values, it turns out that records from different systems contributing to a single golden record contain different countryCode values. To make an informed decision over which value should be used in the golden record, you can create a survivorship rule. For example, the records coming from Salesforce and SAP have the countryCode property set to ‘DK’, while the records coming from MS SQL Server have the countryCode property set to ‘FI’. The survivorship rule’s action can select the winning value based on criteria such as the latest modified value, the record with the most properties, or a preference for a specific provider. In this case, the rule’s action identifies the most frequent value and applies it to the golden record (the chosen value is ‘DK’). To make it easier to find a golden record, you can add tag to it. As an example, let’s add a tag “Nordic” to the golden record with the countryCode property set to ‘DK’. This simplifies the process of locating the tagged record and adding it to the clean project, glossary, or stream. ",

Introduction . This installation process is done through command lines using PowerShell 7, Azure CLI, Kubectl and Helm. The purpose of the chart is to install the CluedIn application. This includes the actual CluedIn server, website, and other services required (storage, queues, etc.) . Note: Before proceeding with the installation, you must ensure that all pre-requisites are met. Login to Azure . Open a PowerShell session, and run the following command: . az login . A browser window will open with Microsoft Azure login page: . Choose the account you want to use, enter the appropriate MFA information. Once you are connected, you will get this confirmation message . You can now read, create and access resources in your Azure tenant through Azure CLI. Create a resource group for your Kubernetes Cluster . In connected PowerShell session, run the following command: . $location = \"westeurope\" # location is the deployment region of the resource group. Example: eastus, centralus, westeurope etc... $rgName = \"rg-cluedin-dev\" # rgName is the name of the resource group. Example: rg-cluedin-dev or rg-cluedin-prod $subscription = \"DataOps-Subscription\" # subscription is the name of the parent subscription for the resource group az group create --location $location --name $rgName --subscription $subscription . Create an AKS Cluster to host your CluedIn application . In this step, you will create an AKS cluster with the following nodepool sizing: . | Node Pool | VM SKU Type | Amount | Purpose | . | Core Pool | Standard_DS2_v2 | 1 | Kubernetes agent internal processes | . | Data Pool | Standard_A8_v2 | 2 | Memory Optimized pool for Databases | . | Processing Pool | Standard_F16s_v2 | 1 | CPU Optimized for Processing workloads | . | General Pool | Standard_F4s_v2 | 2 | General Purpose nodepool to house CluedIn Microservices | . NB: Later, you can choose to downscale or upscale your nodepools depending on your needs and your workloads. | Save this ARM Template and ARM Template Parameters files to your C:\\Users\\$env:username\\AzureTools folder. | Open the create-cluster-params.json file and edit the values of the following parameters: . | resourceName: choose a name for your AKS cluster, for example: aks-cluedin-dev, aks-cluedin-test, aks-cluedin-prod etc… | location: choose the deployment region, for example: uksouth, eastus, westeurope etc… | dnsPrefix: DNS prefix for your cluster, for example: aks-cluedin-dev-dns, aks-cluedin-test-dns etc… | kubernetesVersion: 1.20.9 or later | networkPlugin: can be “kubenet” or “azure”. If you choose azure, The provided template and parameters might not be suitable for the remainder of the install, please refer to Azure documentation for more details. For the remainder of the installation, we are using Kubenet. | . | Once you finish editing the create-cluster-params.json, save and close it. | Run the following script to create your AKS cluster with the predefined parameters: $rgName = \"resource-group-name\" # example: \"rg-cluedin-dev\" $deploymentName = \"name-of-deployment\" # example: \"aks-cluedin-dev-deployment\" $armTemplatePath = \"C:\\Users\\$env:username\\AzureTools\\create-cluster-template.json\" # ARM Template that you saved previously. $paramsPath = \"C:\\Users\\$env:username\\AzureTools\\create-cluster-params.json\" # Params file that you saved and edited previously. az deployment group create ` --name $deploymentName ` --resource-group $rgName ` --template-file $armTemplatePath ` --parameters $paramsPath . | Once the cluster is successfully created, run the following command to check cluster’s information: $rgName = \"resource group name\" # for example: rg-cluedin-dev $clusterName = \"cluster name\" # for example: aks-cluedin-dev az aks show --name $clusterName --resource-group $rgName . | . Now, you are ready to install CluedIn on your cluster. Networking &amp; Security . | Merge your AKS context to your created cluster using the following command: . $rgName = \"resource group name\" # for example: rg-cluedin-dev $clusterName = \"cluster name\" # for example: aks-cluedin-dev az aks get-credentials --resource-group $rgName --name $clusterName . | Install HAProxy ingress controller using Helm: . | Navigate to the AzureTools folder and create the namespace that will host the CluedIn components: kubectl create namespace cluedin helm repo add haproxy-ingress https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/charts helm install haproxy-ingress haproxy-ingress/haproxy-ingress --namespace=cluedin . | Run the following command to retrieve the External IP Address assigned to the controller: kubectl get services -n cluedin . If the external IP shows as “pending”, give it a moment before trying again, then save the External IP address from the output. You will need it for your DNS configuration. | . | DNS Routing (If applicable): Through your DNS provider’s management system, make your host point to the public IP of the ingress controller for the following routes: . | app.&lt;hostname&gt;, for example: app.cluedin-dev.companyName.com | &lt;organizationName&gt;.&lt;hostname&gt;, for example: product.cluedin-dev.companyName.com | . | SSL Certificate (If applicable): Create a secret with the SSL certificates for the following routes: . | Option 1: specific subdomains . | app.&lt;hostname&gt;, for example: app.cluedin-dev.cluedin.com | &lt;organizationName&gt;.&lt;hostname&gt;, for example product.cluedin-dev.companyName.com | clean.&lt;hostname&gt;, for example clean.cluedin-dev.companyName.com | Admin URLs: . | grafana.&lt;hostname&gt;, for example grafana.cluedin-dev.companyName.com | promotheus.&lt;hostname&gt;, for example promotheus.cluedin-dev.companyName.com | alertmanager.&lt;hostname&gt;, for example alertmanager.cluedin-dev.companyName.com | seq.&lt;hostname&gt;, for example seq.cluedin-dev.companyName.com | . | . | Option 2: Wildcard certificate . | If possible, the SSL Certificate can be a wildcard one, for example: *.cluedin-dev.companyName.com | . | The certificate secret can be created using the following command: kubectl create secret tls &lt;secret-name&gt;--key &lt;private-key-path&gt; --cert &lt;public-certificate-path&gt; . NB: private-key-path = path to the tls.key file and public-certificate-path = path to tls.crt file. There is an option to run without SSL, although not recommended, especially for production environments. | . | . Install CluedIn using Helm . | Start by registering the Helm chart repository containing the CluedIn chart: helm repo add cluedin https://cluedin-io.github.io/Charts/ helm repo update . | Create a secret with your Docker credentials to access CluedIn images through Docker Hub: Run the following command: kubectl create secret docker-registry docker-registry-key ` --namespace cluedin ` --docker-server='docker.io' ` --docker-username='&lt;your Dockerhub username&gt;' ` --docker-password='&lt;your Dockerhub password&gt;' ` --docker-email='&lt;your Docker Hub email&gt;' . A confirmation message will appear when the secret is created. | Make sure you are in your AzureTools folder, then using the command below, you will fetch the values.yml configuration file to configure your CluedIn instance helm inspect values cluedin/cluedin &gt; values.yml . The file will be downloaded to your AzureTools folder. | . Fill out the values.yml file, specifically the following sections: . Default Organization and application Admin . bootstrap: organization: name: \"orgName\" # Organization Account Name, example: Products, Customers, People, Vendors etc... email: \"admin@companyName.com\" # Admin account's Email username: \"admin@companyName.com \"# Admin account's username (should be the same as above) prefix: \"orgNamePrefix\" # Organization prefix used in the URL to access this organization (tenant), can be the same as organizationName password: \"!!!StrongPassword123!!!\" # Admin account's password emailDomain: \"companyName.com\" # Admin account's Email domain, can be left empty and admin email's domain will be used in this case. Please note that the organization name cannot contain hyphens or dots in it, and that organization prefix can have hyphens, but not dots. DNS Configuration . If your hostname is companyName.com and you choose a prefix to your CluedIn dev application that is cluedin-dev, your DNS section should look like the following: . dns: hostname: \"companyName.com\" # Base host to use for all URLs. Will be combined with the organization name e.g https://&lt;org-name&gt;.&lt;hostname&gt; prefix: \"cluedin-dev\" # Usually a qualifier to the CluedIn instance, but can be left empty subdomains: # The following are the default, each one corresponds to a subdomain application: \"app\" # For app.cluedin-dev.companyName.com openrefine: \"clean\" # For clean.cluedin-dev.companyName.com grafanaAdmin: \"grafana\" # For grafana.cluedin-dev.companyName.com prometheusAdmin: \"prometheus\" # For prometheus.cluedin-dev.companyName.com alertManagerAdmin: \"alertmanager\" # For alertmanager.cluedin-dev.companyName.com seq: \"seq\" # For seq.cluedin-dev.companyName.com . Please note that the above is also equivalent to: . dns: hostname: \"cluedin-dev.companyName.com\" # The prefix is added to the hostname prefix: \"\" # No further prefix defined subdomains: application: \"app\" openrefine: \"clean\" grafanaAdmin: \"grafana\" prometheusAdmin: \"prometheus\" alertManagerAdmin: \"alertmanager\" seq: \"seq\" . Also, all the subdomains values can be overridden by values that you prefer, like in the following example: . dns: hostname: \"companyName.com\" # Main company's hostname is used prefix: \"\" # No prefix used subdomains: application: \"app-cluedin-dev\" openrefine: \"clean-cluedin-dev\" grafanaAdmin: \"grafana-cluedin-dev\" prometheusAdmin: \"prometheus-cluedin-dev\" alertManagerAdmin: \"alertmanager-cluedin-dev\" seq: \"seq-cluedin-dev\" . In this case, the app URL will be: app-cluedin-dev.companyName.com . Finally, if you choose to use the Ingress controller’s external IP with no specific hostname until you get your DNS configuration sorted out, the DNS section would be: . dns: hostname: \"EXTERNAL_IP_VALUE.nip.io\" # For example 20.90.172.127.nip.io prefix: \"\" . SSL and HTTPS (If applicable) . If you are configuring HTTPS too, modify the following section as per your needs: . ingress: forceHttps: True # Set to True if you want to force HTTPS usage annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: haproxy ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: \"false\" tls: hosts: [ \"*.cluedin-dev.companyName.com\" ] # enumerate the hosts defined in the certificate, or wildcard URL. secretName: \"SSL-Secret-Name\" # TLS Secret to use for ingress - If no hosts create a wildcard host hasClusterCA: false # If certificates are generated by a local CA (secret has 'ca.crt' section) . Save the values.yml file. Please note that these different settings can be modified later even after the installation of CluedIn. Finally, install Cluedin . Run the following command to install CluedIn: . $releaseName = \"choose a name for the release\" # Example: cluedin-dev $pathToValuesYml = \"Path to values.yml\" # Example: C:\\Users\\$env:username\\AzureTools\\values.yml helm upgrade $releaseName cluedin/cluedin -n cluedin --install --values $pathToValuesYml . Upon running the helm upgrade command, Helm will begin installation of CluedIn platform into your Kubernetes cluster. At the end of the installation process, you will be prompted with the configuration of your install, URLs you can use to access your freshly installed platform. All the workloads may take up to 10 minutes to spin up. You can check your status by running: . kubectl get pods -n cluedin . In a healthy installation scenario, all the pods should be in a Ready state. Additionally, you can check the platform’s health by going to https://app.&lt;hostname&gt;/api/status healthcheck API. You will be able to login to the platform by going to https://app.&lt;hostname&gt;/ (or http://app.&lt;hostname&gt;/ if not using SSL). Next Steps . After logging in to the platform, you can proceed with enabling single sign on for your users to access the platform, as well as start loading data in via Data Sources or installing some crawlers. Below you will find some useful links on achieving the above: . | Enabling Single Sign On | Restricting access to CluedIn Clean via Basic Authentication | Install a crawler/custom component | . Optionally, you can also adjust other settings to cater for more complex scenarios: . | Persistence/Using Managed Disks | Azure SQL Server | Scaling | . ",

For example, the cron expression 0 18 * * * means that the files will be exported every day at 6:00 PM. | . | (Optional) File Name Pattern – a file name pattern for the export file. For more information, see File name patterns. For example, in the {ContainerName}.{OutputFormat} pattern, {ContainerName} is the Target Name in the stream, and {OutputFormat} is the output format that you select in step 3g.

By default, all changes and properties in a clue are treated as something that will play a role in the hashing process. Developers can instruct Vocabularies to “Ignore Hashing”, which means that even if these values change on subsequent crawls, it won’t play a role in telling CluedIn that the data has changed. Only properties that have changed or been added that are not marked with “Ignore Hashing” will instruct CluedIn that things have changed. For example, many tools will change a timestamp value when the record has been viewed - not modified, but simply opened or viewed. You might find that this is important to change the clue, but in many occasions you will find that this change is insignificant and you will want to use your Vocabulary mappings to instruct CluedIn to ignore this change and throw away the clue from processing. This is typically to help increase the performance and lack of load placed onto the CluedIn processing servers. ",

There are situations where you actually don’t want your new data to be in “Append” mode, but rather you want to change the way that CluedIn will process and treat this data. The most common examples include: . | You are sending data to CluedIn with the intention to delete it from CluedIn and/or downstream Export Targets as well. | You are sending data to CluedIn with “Blank Values” and your intention is to ask CluedIn to “forget” that this column or columns ever had a value for this. For example, you had a phone number from a company and you would rather now have a blank value for this as the phone number is no longer active. | You are sending data to CluedIn with an updated value for a column and your intention is to ask CluedIn to REMOVE the old identifier or edge that could have been built off of this, and REPLACE it with the new ones, not just APPEND over the top. | You are sending blank data to CluedIn and you actually want CluedIn to treat the values as Blank and hence if a Golden Record has a value of “Hello” you actually want to turn that value into “”. | .

    "content": "To enhance the efficiency of your deduplication project and to be able to smoothly revert merges, we recommend that you follow these guidelines. | When you need to run a deduplication project on a large set of data, we recommend that you start small and limit the size of data. This approach allows you to to verify the accuracy and efficiency of your matching rules before applying them to the entire data set. If the deduplication result doesn’t meet your expectations, you can easily and quickly revert changes and start again. | When it comes to matching rules, our recommendation is to create separate projects for strict and fuzzy matching functions, grouped by domain. There are two reasons for this recommendation: . | Quick and efficient merging and unmerging. If all rules are consolidated within a single project and you decide to revert changes, all rules will be reverted, even those that were executed correctly. To prevent this, create separate projects for individual sets of rules. This way, you can selectively revert only those projects where rules didn’t work as intended. | Streamlined management of projects on a day-to-day basis. If you have projects targeting a specific domain, and the data for that domain has been updated, then you can easily re-evaluate those specific projects. For example, suppose you have one project that merges duplicates based on first and last names and another project that merges duplicates based on addresses. Now, you add the libpostal library to enrich addresses. In this scenario, you can easily re-evaluate only the address-based project, knowing that first and last names have remained unchanged. | . | To increase the efficiency of your deduplication projects, start by running projects with strict equality matching functions to eliminate obvious duplicates. | Once you’ve reached a state with no duplicates based on equality matching, proceed to execute projects with fuzzy matching functions for a more nuanced deduplication process. Since you’ve already merged some records based on equality matching functions, this means that you now have fewer duplicates in the system, so fuzzy matching would run much faster. | When you achieve the desired outcome on a small data set, grow big and proceed to run the deduplication project on the entire data set. | .

This process maintains full traceability, allowing you to identify contributing records for the resulting golden record and providing the possibility to revert changes if necessary. You can reduce the number of duplicates in the system proactively even before creating a deduplication project. For this purpose, CluedIn provides the possibility of merging by identifiers: those data parts that have identical primary identifiers or additional identifiers are merged during processing.

CluedIn PaaS Install CluedIn within your company’s Azure infrastructure Local Install CluedIn locally to test its main features and write custom code CluedIn is designed with the Microservices Architecture in mind. That means that CluedIn, as an application, is a set of interconnected services: a web application, GraphQL API, databases, message queues, and so on. Each CluedIn service runs in a separate container, allowing us to test, scale, and monitor each service effectively. While CluedIn is a cloud-native application, you can also run it on your local machine. Docker Compose is the technology that allows us to run a group of containers on our local computer easily. You just run a few commands, and a new CluedIn instance is up and running on your laptop or desktop computer. You can use it for testing and development. Please, follow the Local installation guide for more details. When it comes to production, Kubernetes runs CluedIn services in the cloud and ensures that the containers are healthy and scale as they should. While all modern cloud providers support Kubernetes, we recommend running CluedIn on Microsoft Azure with the help of Azure Kubernetes Service. Read more about it in the PaaS installation section of our documentation. The following video explores the features and differences between the SaaS, PaaS, and local options for deploying CluedIn. CluedIn team performs installation activities on all business days except Friday. Deploying on a Friday carries higher risk because issues may not surface immediately and can escalate into weekend incidents with fewer people available to respond. As a best practice, it is recommended to schedule installations earlier in the week (Tuesday–Thursday) to allow time for monitoring, troubleshooting, and stabilization. Azure Managed Application . CluedIn is available as an Azure Managed Application, making deployment and operation effortless for you. Depending on the model you choose—PaaS or SaaS—CluedIn can be deployed within your company’s infrastructure or within our infrastructure. Regardless of the chosen model, this setup allows us to handle almost everything for you, including post-installation, upgrades, backups, and monitoring. This ensures that you do not need to worry about operating and managing a cluster yourself, as long as the CluedIn operations team has full access to your cluster. Private SaaS vs. PaaS .

    "content": "A golden record is made up of many data parts. These data parts can appear from clean projects, deduplication projects, files, crawlers, or manual modifications. For example, if you create a clean project and it affects a golden record property, then a new data part is added to the golden record history, showing the affected property along with other metadata properties. Similarly, if you manually edit a golden record property, then a new data part is added to the golden record history, showing the new property value. Every time a data part appears in the history, a branch is created. Branches help organize data parts by sources and easily retrieve data parts that were created from one source. For example, data parts that appeared from one clean project belong to one branch, and data parts from a different clean project belong to a different branch. Each branch has a head that contains values from the data parts belonging to that branch. The same golden record property can have different values in each head. By default, the latest value coming to CluedIn or the latest manually modified value is used in the golden record. If you want to determine which value should be used in a golden record property, create a survivorship rule. The following diagram illustrates the process of establishing a golden record. By default, the History page displays the data parts arranged by the sort date (this is the date when CluedIn received the data part). You can explore the data parts using the following views: . | Data part view . | Golden record view . | . Data part view . The data part view is the default view that shows all data parts that make up a golden record. Each data part has the following attributes: . | A color circle that represents a branch. A branch contains the data part versions that appeared from the same source. For example, if you have a crawler that changes some properties of the data part, these changes will be added to the branch as separate data part versions. By selecting the color circle, you can view the branch (1) and its versions (2, 3). | An icon that represents a source. A source is a place where the data part is coming from. A source can be a clean project, a deduplication project, a manual data entry project, a file, a crawler, and so on. | A title of the data part that consists of the source name and additional details. For example, if the source is the clean project, then the title also includes the clean project name. You can view the source by selecting the title. | A data part ID (also referred to as record ID). You can view the data part properties (vocabulary keys) by selecting the ID number. These data part properties are used to produce a head, which is then processed by survivorship rules to determine the operational values for the golden record. | Data part details, such as the user who created the data part and dates associated with the data part. For more information about what each date means, see Filters. | Data part status that indicates the type of change made on the data part level. For more information about each status, see Dat part statuses. | . By expanding the data part, you can view a table with the metadata properties and vocabulary keys associated with the data part. Each property is marked with the change type label, which indicates whether the property is newly added or changed from one data part version to another. Each data part is an individual entity, and it is not linked to other data parts in any way, except if these data parts belong to one branch. Because each data part is individual, the first data part in the branch is marked with the Added status and does not contain previous values. If the subsequent data part within the branch contain some changes compared to the first data part in the branch, then such data parts are marked with the Changed status. Golden record view . The golden record view appears when you select any metadata properties or vocabulary keys on the filters pane on the left side of the History page. This view shows all records (1) where the selected property or vocabulary key is used, along with the value (2) that is used in the golden record (this is the value that is shown on the Property tab of the golden record details page). By looking at the sort date, you can track the historical changes in the property value across all data parts. Part ID from the golden record view and Record ID from the data part view are the same. Filters . The History page contains various filters to help you navigate through the data parts: . | Data source filter – you can filter the data parts by the data source that indicates a place where a data part was produced. By default, the data parts from all data sources are displayed on the History page. | Date filter – you can filter the data parts by one of the following dates: . | Sort date – this date is determined by selecting the first available date among modified, created, and discovery dates. In most cases, this is the date when CluedIn received the data. | Modified date – the date when the data part was last modified in the source system. | Created date – the date when the data part was originally created in the source system. | Discovery date – the date when the data part was created in CluedIn. | . | Metadata filter – you can select any metadata property and see the data parts where it is used. | Vocabulary key filter – you can select any vocabulary key and see the data parts where it is used, as well as the value chosen for the golden record.

    "content": "CluedIn provides a powerful GraphQL API that is very helpful in almost every interaction with CluedIn (one of a few exceptions is Ingestion Endpoints that are not GraphQL). You can read about CluedIn GraphQL in a separate article: documentation.cluedin.net/consume/graphql. When you open the Consume section in your CluedIn instance, you will find a GraphQL playground where you can run GraphQL queries. In our example, we have some /Duck entities (from the DuckTales). To find them, I can run a query like this: . Simple GraphQL search query . { search(query:\"+entityType:/Duck\") { entries { id name entityType } } } . | The query will return me the top 20 of the /Duck entities. | The query parameter tells the API to filter the response by a given business domain (previously entity type). | You can also specify the entity properties you want to get in the payload: id, name, and entityType. | . GraphQL search query with variables and cursor . We can sophisticate the query a little so that it will take parameters from the GraphQL variables: . query ($query: String, $pageSize: Int) { search( query: $query pageSize: $pageSize sort: FIELDS sortFields: {field: \"id\", direction: ASCENDING} ) { cursor entries { id name entityType } } } . Variables: . { \"query\": \"+entityType:/Duck\", \"pageSize\": 10000 } . Here are a few things to notice in this query: . | query ($query: String, $pageSize: Int) – we defined a query with parameters. We can also give this query a name: query searchEntities($query: String, $pageSize: Int) | sort: FIELDS sortFields: {field: \"id\", direction: ASCENDING} – it’s important to sort by a unique field to get predictable results when you page data. | cursor – we ask CluedIn to return a special value that we can pass to our next query to get the next page of results. | \"pageSize\": 10000 – by default, the page size is 20, so if you have millions of entities, you will get only the first 20. Setting the page size to its maximum value (10000) will decrease the number of requests you send to CluedIn API, but there are situations when you only want to get a few entities from the top, and a query with a smaller page size will be faster. | .

    "content": "Installation and initialization . You can use any programming language to send a GraphQL request to CluedIn and get the data back. Let’s explore how you can do it in Python. | Install the latest version of CluedIn Python SDK: . %pip install cluedin . | Import it together with Pandas (we will use Pandas to load data in DataFrames): . import pandas as pd import cluedin . | You need an API token. You can copy or create a new one by going to Administration &gt; API Tokens in CluedIn. | In our example, CluedIn is now installed at https://foobar.contoso.com/. We now need to initialize a Context for our CluedIn instance by providing org_name (foobar), domain (contoso.com), and the access_token (the one you copied from CluedIn UI): . ctx = cluedin.Context.from_dict({ 'domain': 'contoso.com', 'org_name': 'foobar', 'access_token': '{paste_your_token_here}' }) . | . Running a GraphQL query . We can now run GraphQL queries from Python code: . query = \"\"\" query searchEntities($query: String, $pageSize: Int) { search( query: $query pageSize: $pageSize sort: FIELDS, sortFields: {field: \"id\", direction: ASCENDING} ) { cursor entries { id name entityType } } } \"\"\" variables = { 'query': '+entityType:/Duck', 'pageSize': 3 } cluedin.gql.gql(ctx, query=query, variables=variables) . The result is top three entities (because we use the page size = 3 for demo purpose), and we also get a cursor that we can use to get the next page: . {'data': {'search': {'cursor': 'ewAiAFAAYQBnAGUAIgA6ADEALAAiAFAAYQBnAGUAUwBpAHoAZQAiADoAMwAsACIAQwBvAG0AcABvAHMAaQB0AGUAQQBmAHQAZQByACIAOgB7AH0ALAAiAFMAZQBhAHIAYwBoAEEAZgB0AGUAcgAiADoAWwAiADYAMwA1ADMAOAAzAGEAOQAtADkAYwA3ADUALQA1AGQANgAxAC0AOABmADIAYgAtAGYAZQA0ADkANgBmAGQAOAAyAGIAZQA3ACIALAAiADYAMwA1ADMAOAAzAGEAOQAtADkAYwA3ADUALQA1AGQANgAxAC0AOABmADIAYgAtAGYAZQA0ADkANgBmAGQAOAAyAGIAZQA3ACIAXQB9AA==', 'entries': [{'id': '145afb55-4e78-5dad-b208-633b5b6d19cf', 'name': 'Donald Duck', 'entityType': '/Duck'}, {'id': '17bad60e-6782-5ae5-84bf-7efe05e78e58', 'name': 'Jake McDuck', 'entityType': '/Duck'}, {'id': '635383a9-9c75-5d61-8f2b-fe496fd82be7', 'name': 'Dewey Duck', 'entityType': '/Duck'}]}}} . Getting the next page . We can change our code to pass the cursor as a parameter: . query = \"\"\" query searchEntities($cursor: PagingCursor, $query: String, $pageSize: Int) { search( query: $query cursor: $cursor pageSize: $pageSize sort: FIELDS, sortFields: {field: \"id\", direction: ASCENDING} ) { cursor entries { id name entityType } } } \"\"\" variables = { 'query': '+entityType:/Duck', 'pageSize': 3 'cursor': 'ewAiAFAAYQBnAGUAIgA6ADEALAAiAFAAYQBnAGUAUwBpAHoAZQAiADoAMwAsACIAQwBvAG0AcABvAHMAaQB0AGUAQQBmAHQAZQByACIAOgB7AH0ALAAiAFMAZQBhAHIAYwBoAEEAZgB0AGUAcgAiADoAWwAiADYAMwA1ADMAOAAzAGEAOQAtADkAYwA3ADUALQA1AGQANgAxAC0AOABmADIAYgAtAGYAZQA0ADkANgBmAGQAOAAyAGIAZQA3ACIALAAiADYAMwA1ADMAOAAzAGEAOQAtADkAYwA3ADUALQA1AGQANgAxAC0AOABmADIAYgAtAGYAZQA0ADkANgBmAGQAOAAyAGIAZQA3ACIAXQB9AA==' } cluedin.gql.gql(ctx, query=query, variables=variables) .

Using a generator . But what if you want to avoid manually passing a new cursor to every new call? You can just use the cluedin.gql.entries method, and it will return you a Generator that you can convert to a list or just iterate as you wish: ... # this is where you need a smaller page size # if you don't want to iterate to the end variables = { 'query': '+entityType:/Duck', 'pageSize': 2 } generator = cluedin.gql.entries(ctx, query=query, variables=variables) print(next(generator)) print(next(generator)) . Result: . {'id': '145afb55-4e78-5dad-b208-633b5b6d19cf', 'name': 'Donald Duck', 'entityType': '/Duck'} {'id': '17bad60e-6782-5ae5-84bf-7efe05e78e58', 'name': 'Jake McDuck', 'entityType': '/Duck'} . Using automatic pagination . You can also load all entities in a DataFrame, in this case, it makes sense using the maximum page size (10000) to reduce the number of calls to the server: . query = \"\"\" query searchEntities($cursor: PagingCursor, $query: String, $pageSize: Int) { search( query: $query cursor: $cursor pageSize: $pageSize sort: FIELDS, sortFields: {field: \"id\", direction: ASCENDING} ) { cursor entries { id name entityType } } } \"\"\" variables = { 'query': '+entityType:/Duck', 'pageSize': 10_000 } print(pd.DataFrame(cluedin.gql.entries(ctx, query=query, variables=variables))) . Result: . id name entityType 0 145afb55-4e78-5dad-b208-633b5b6d19cf Donald Duck /Duck 1 17bad60e-6782-5ae5-84bf-7efe05e78e58 Jake McDuck /Duck 2 635383a9-9c75-5d61-8f2b-fe496fd82be7 Dewey Duck /Duck 3 6ae43a44-81b4-5fd7-9c7b-47cb24d407ea Angus McDuck /Duck 4 9353b703-13d8-59a1-886c-f40b95283c06 Hortense McDuck /Duck 5 93b92835-96f2-56a9-98c0-c848236521a9 Matilda McDuck /Duck 6 a388a77d-7d43-51d1-87b2-efb4f854b5ad Fergus McDuck /Duck 7 b2fb05cb-e806-5088-955b-2ff3f9261236 Scrooge McDuck /Duck 8 b8fc5baf-b679-5e26-abb5-50ca77467992 Huey Duck /Duck 9 cd8fe1dd-5637-5037-931e-f8bf1a15c0b4 Della Duck /Duck 10 f5bf5d66-5698-515a-800e-9d778d916dcd Louie Duck /Duck . Using the search method . Starting from CluedIn Python SDK 2.5.0, you can shrink the code above to one line and get almost the same result. The difference is that it will also return you all codes and properties of entities, and you don’t have to copy and paste the same GraphQL query every time you want to query some data: . # this will return all the queried entities with all properties and codes print(pd.DataFrame(cluedin.gql.search(ctx, '+entityType:/Duck'))) . Using the search method with a subset of data . Finally, if you only want a subset of data, you can use the itertools.islice, but then remember to set a smaller page_size to not query more data than you need: . from itertools import islice # gets a generaror that queries entities from the server by three gen = cluedin.gql.search(ctx, '+entityType:/Duck', page_size=3) # wrap in an iterator that stops after three iterations iter = islice(gen, 3) # convert to DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(iter) print(df) . Or simply: . pd.DataFrame(itertools.islice(cluedin.gql.search(ctx, '+entityType:/Duck', 3), 3)) . ",

By default, it is just app, but can be changed in the values file. | cluedin – references the main CluedIn URL you would access on a daily basis. | . To register an application in the Azure portal . | In the Azure portal, go to the tenant in which you want to register the application. | Search for and select Microsoft Entra ID. | Under Manage, select App registrations &gt; New registration. | Enter a display Name for your application. | Select the Supported account types that can use the application. | Update Redirect URI to Web and set the URL to the app subdomain of your instance with the path of /auth/signin-oidc. e.g. https://app.domain.com/auth/signin-oidc . | Select Register.

To grant SSO access to external users . | Select Authentication. | Scroll down to Supported account types and change the mode to Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant). | Select Save. | . This will allow guests invited to your Microsoft Entra ID to be able to use this application for single sign-on. The process remains the same whereby the user signs in like you normally would. Add API permissions for Microsoft Graph . When you register an application in the Azure portal, the Microsoft Graph API with the User.Read permission is added automatically. You need to add additional permissions for Microsoft Graph. To add API permissions for Microsoft Graph . | Select API permissions. | In the Configured permissions section, click on the existing Microsoft Graph entry. | In the right pane, select the following permissions: email, offline_access, openid, and profile. At the bottom of the pane, select Update permissions. The API permissions for Microsoft Graph are updated. | . For more information about API permissions, see Microsoft documentation. Expose an API . You need to register a web API with the Microsoft identity platform and expose it to the client app by adding a scope. By registering your web API and exposing it through scope, you can provide permissions-based access to authorized users that access your API. To expose the API . | Select Expose an API. | In the Scopes defined by this API section, select Add a scope. | For the first-time setup, you will need to specify the Application ID URI.

For detailed instructions on how to configure an app to expose web API, see Microsoft documentation. | Select Add scope when done. | . Map Microsoft Entra application roles to CluedIn roles . After you have created your application registration and attached it to your CluedIn instance, you can create the application roles on the Microsoft Entra side. These roles will be translated into the CluedIn platform roles and assigned to the users as they sign in to the application when the Automatic Role Synchronization option is enabled in the CluedIn settings. If you change the role of the user after they sign in, they will need to sign out and sign back in for the new role to take affect. To map Microsoft Entra application roles to CluedIn roles . | Select App roles. | On the menu, select Create app role. | Enter the details of the role. See CluedIn roles for recommended values. | Select Apply to save your changes. The role is added to the App roles list. | Repeat steps 3-5 to add all roles listed below. | . In the CluedIn application, you can find all CluedIn roles by navigating to Administration &gt; Roles. Any changes made in the application registration will be saved in your Azure subscription. We do not impose strict requirements on how app roles are set up, so you can follow your organization’s internal requirements. By default, any user will be able to sign into CluedIn but won’t have a role assigned. If you would prefer to reject the user from signing in, you can set this under the Enterprise application of the same name of the app registration. Within properties is a toggle switch called Assignment required? which can be used for this purpose. You can then add groups and role assignments on the left-hand blade labelled Users and groups.

    "content": "In this article, you will learn how to tag records with data quality issues using golden record rules and CluedIn Copilot. We will use invalid email address as an example of a data quality issue. To tag records with data quality issues . | To begin with, we have ingested, mapped, and processed a file containing contact data. Some records include invalid email addresses. Note that the email addresses in rows 1–3 violate common email address formatting rules. | To tag records with such data quality issues, create a data part rule and add an action to tag records if the email value does not match the acceptable patten of a common regular expression (for example, ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$). You can use the Conditions section of the action to specify the acceptable pattern for the vocabulary key value. Alternatively, you can use CluedIn Copilot to create a data part rule. First, ask Copilot to generate a common regular expression that would check for valid email format. For example, you can use the following prompt. Write a common regular expression that would check for valid email format and shortly describe it. Then, instruct Copilot to create a data part rule using the prompt similar to the following. Create a golden record rule named \"User email format validation\" for the TrainingContact entity type. This rule should use CluedIn AI action on the trainingcontact.email vocabulary key to tag with \"Invalid email format\" any email with a pattern that doesn't match the above regex. | Next, activate and re-process the rule. To verify that the rule has been applied, go to search and use the Tags filter. As a result, you will see all records where the email value is in the invalid format. Records with invalid email addresses contain the corresponding tag. | When the records with data quality issues are tagged, you can then create a clean project to fix such issues. To do it, in the upper-right corner of the search results page, open the three-dot menu, and select Clean. | . ",

The members of the policy rule with the mask action will see the icon indicating that the value is masked due to access control policy. Masked value cannot be retrieved in any way, and it cannot be edited. The mask value action in data part and golden record rules will be deprecated in future releases. Therefore, use the mask action in access control policy rules. Add/edit . This action allows the members of the policy rule to add new properties to the golden record and/or edit the existing properties in the golden record. The properties that the members can add/edit depend on the vocabularies and/or vocabulary keys selected in the policy rule: . | If the policy rule is applied to all vocabulary keys, then the members can add or edit all vocabulary keys that are used in golden records that match the rule’s filters and conditions. | If policy rule is applied to specific vocabulary keys, then the members can add or edit only the selected vocabulary keys that are used in golden records that match the rule’s filters and conditions. | If the policy rule is applied to specific vocabularies, then the members can add or edit any vocabulary keys belonging to the specified vocabularies that are used in golden records that match the rule’s filters and conditions. | . The add/edit action takes precedence over the view action. If a user is a member of both a policy rule with the view action and a policy rule with the add/edit action, and both rules apply to the same vocabulary keys, it means that the user will be able to add or edit those vocabulary keys. Add/edit action and RACI permissions . When adding a property to the golden record, you might want to create a new value. This is possible only if you have the needed RACI permissions: either you are the owner of the vocabulary or you have the Consulted access to the management.datacatalog claim. When you are trying to add or edit a property in a golden record, CluedIn first checks if you have the required RACI permissions and then it checks if you are allowed to make changes to that specific golden record according to the access control policy. If your access level is less than Consulted, you will not be able to add or edit the property in a golden record. ",

    "content": "Sometimes, the conditions in property and pre-process rules might appear cumbersome when you need to execute complex logic on your records. In such cases, you can use the advanced mapping capabilities that allow you to modify clues by executing the code. From a security perspective, advanced mapping runs on a virtual machine that does not have access to your network. The advanced mapping code can be executed on the following levels: . | Code mapping before sending clues – default level that allows you to modify clues using built-in methods. Our article focuses on this level because it is the most commonly used. | Code mapping before creating clues – additional level that only allows you to modify record values using the following code: . value['customer.companyName'] = 'Star'; [value] . Where 'customer.companyName' is the name of the property, 'Star' is the value that will be set to the property in each record, and [value] is an element that indicates that the code is executed for each record. | . Example . Suppose you have ingested the revenue data, and you want to add tags to facilitate the retrieval of golden records in CluedIn. You want to add a tag “Golden” to those records where the revenue is greater than or equal to 1000000; and another tag “Silver” to those records where the revenue is greater than or equal to 500000 . You can achieve that by writing the advanced mapping code similar to the following example. if (getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.revenue') &gt;= 1000000) { addTag('Golden'); } else if (getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.revenue') &gt;= 500000) { addTag('Silver'); } [value] . [value] is an important element that indicates that the code is executed for each clue. To modify clues by writing the advanced mapping code . | On the navigation pane, go to Integrations &gt; Data Sources. Then, find and open the data set. | Go to the Map tab, and then select Advanced. | In the upper-right corner, make sure that Code mapping before sending clues is selected. | Select Run to load all clues that were created from the data set.

Please refer to CluedIn Expression Language (C.E.L.) for all string and math methods. This section is focused on built-in CluedIn-specific methods. getVocabularyKeyValue . Retrieves the clues that have a specific vocabulary key in order to apply further actions on the values or clues. In the following example, the code retrieves specific values of 'customer.industry' and adds a tag “Golden Oil &amp; Gas” to those clues where 'customer.revenue' is greater than 750000. if ( (getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.industry') === 'Natural Gas Distribution' || getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.industry') === 'Oil &amp; Gas Production') &amp;&amp; getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.revenue') &gt; 750000 ) { addTag('Golden Oil &amp; Gas'); } [value] . setVocabularyKeyValue . Changes the vocabulary key values. In the following example, the code retrieves the current value of 'customer.industry' using getVocabularyKeyValue, converts it to lowercase using toLowerCase(), and then sets the updated lowercase value using setVocabularyKeyValue. setVocabularyKeyValue('customer.industry', getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.industry').toLowerCase()); [value] . getEntityProperty . Retrieves the clues that have a specific entity property in order to apply further actions on the values or clues. In the following example, the code takes the 'name' property from the clue, converts it to uppercase using toUpperCase(), and then sets the result as the value of the 'description' property for the clue. const name = getEntityProperty('name'); setEntityProperty('description', name.toUpperCase()); [value] . setEntityProperty . Adds or changes the value of the entity property, such as name, description, entityType, date created, and so on. In the following example, the code checks if the 'customer.industry' vocabulary key is set to 'Precious Metals', and if it is, the code sets the 'description' property of the clue to the specified string. if (getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.industry') === 'Precious Metals') { setEntityProperty('description', 'This record comes from corporate CRM'); } [value] . removeVocabularyKey . Removes vocabulary key from the clues. In the following example, the code removes the 'customer.revenue' vocabulary key from all clues. removeVocabularyKey('customer.revenue') [value] . quarantine . Send the clues that do not meet certain conditions to quarantine. In the following example, the code checks if the value of 'customer.revenue' is absent or equal to 0. If it is, the code send such clues to quarantine. const customerRevenue = getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.revenue'); if (customerRevenue === undefined || customerRevenue === null || customerRevenue === 0) { quarantine(); } [value] . addAlias . Adds aliases to the clues. In the following example, the code adds an alias taken from the 'customer.company' vocabulary key to each clue. addAlias(getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.company')); [value] . addTag . Adds tags to the clues. In the following example, the code checks if the value of 'customer.industry' is equal to “Oil &amp; Gas”. If the condition is true, a tag “Oil &amp; Gas” is added to the corresponding clues. if (getVocabularyKeyValue('customer.industry') === 'Oil &amp; Gas') { addTag('Oil &amp; Gas'); } [value] . addCode . Adds an identifier (previously known as code) to the clue. The identifier usually consists of a business domain (previously known as entity type), an origin, and a specific value. You can specify the required origin and value to generate the code. In the following example, the first parameter is the origin and the second parameter is the value. The resulting code would be \"/Customer#myOrigin:myCode\". addCode(\"myCode\",\"myOrigin\") [value] . removeTags . Removes all tags from the clue. removeTags() [value] . removeCodes . Removes all codes from the Codes section of the clue. removeCodes() [value] . removeAliases . Removes all aliases from the clue. removeAliases() [value] . fillVocabularyKeysIfBlank . By default, CluedIn ignores vocabulary keys that have empty values during ingestion. This means such keys will not be written to the entity unless explicitly handled. The fillVocabularyKeysIfBlank() method allows you to populate these empty vocabulary keys with a zero-width space character (\\u200B) when passed as a parameter. This makes them visually appear blank while still ensuring the keys exist in the entity. It is useful when downstream processes, such as mapping rules or deduplication, rely on the presence of those keys. fillVocabularyKeysIfBlank(\"\\u200B\"); [value] . In the above example, all empty vocabulary keys are assigned a zero-width space. This allows them to be treated as non-empty during rule evaluation or processing. Use case example . Suppose you have a data source where certain fields (such as customer.email or customer.phoneNumber) must be intentionally cleared to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA. By default, CluedIn ignores empty values during ingestion, which means the existing values in the golden record are retained. The following script ensures that the target vocabulary keys are explicitly updated with blank values instead : . Note: The zero-width space will not be visible in the CluedIn UI but serves as a placeholder for blank fields, enabling consistent processing and data quality validation. ",

If you’re using an existing vNet as part of the deployment, you will need to ensure that the AKS cluster identity has appropriate permissions to manage the subnet. This is because AKS nodes will join and leave the subnet at times. Out of the box, CluedIn will use a public ingress and egress load balancer to serve traffic initially regardless of vNet choice. In advanced networking setups, we recommend changing this so ingress is only accessible via a private vNet. The following sections will cover how to do this, and as part of the CluedIn managed service, we will work with you to ensure it’s done in a supported way. Using an existing vNet . If you are using an existing virtual network as part of your CluedIn deployment, you need to consider the following security aspects: . | The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least Network Contributor permissions on the subnet within your virtual network.

The two options supported are Virtual network peering and Private link service with private endpoint. If your subnets overlap in any way, the only option will be Private link service with private endpoint. Virtual network peering . To configure virtual network peering, refer to Microsoft documentation. As all resources have already been created, you only need to follow the Create virtual network peer step in the tutorial. Private link service with private endpoint . In the event there is overlapping of subnets, this is not a problem as private endpoints also work here. This is slightly more complicated than virtual network peering and we’ll offer a bit of guidance here. Microsoft has a document explaining how to achieve this. As AKS maintains the load balancers, and the vnet is created at deployment time (or an existing one is used), you only need to follow the steps Create a private link service and Create a private endpoint in the above document. For the Private Link Service, ensure that the Load balancer is set to kubernetes-internal and uses the frontend IP address from the private range. The Source NAT vnet and subnet should default correctly. Ensure that Source NAT subnet is set to No and it is best to assign a Static Private IP address. For the Private endpoint, ensure you select the virtual network that will be used to access CluedIn along with the subnet. It is recommended to statically allocate an IP address here as this will be used as the entry point for CluedIn and will be required as part of your DNS at a later stage. Next steps . The next step is to test access from the private network to CluedIn to ensure that traffic can reach the endpoint as expected. By default, ICMP packets do not respond, but HTTPS (443/TCP) will. It may cause an error due to certificate, but this can be corrected. When you’ve confirmed that traffic is flowing, the final steps are to set up host name/DNS and TLS.

CluedIn, as a Master Data Management system, encourages users to work with data using a UI and low-code approach. You can do a full data cycle from ingesting data into CluedIn to data modeling, transformation, cleaning, enriching, deduplication, and export without writing a single line of code. However, there are situations when automation and basic scripting can save the day. Moreover, in the same way as we can free business users from dealing with IT and code, we can free them from repetitive actions in UI when, for example, you implement a CI/CD pipeline between your development, staging, and production instances. In this article, we will implement basic automation without knowing too much about it beforehand. Let’s start with the fact that CluedIn UI communicates with the server via GraphQL API. ",

A job defines a specific task assigned to the agent—such as detecting duplicates, identifying and resolving data quality issues, or generating rules—based on a specific set of golden records. Setting up an AI agent job involves the following steps: . | Creating a job – add a new job for an AI agent. | Adding a data source – specify a set of golden records the agent should operate on. | Configuring a prompt – define the instructions the agent should follow to complete the task. | Testing the job – verify the job’s setup by running a preliminary test on a subset of golden records to ensure the agent performs as expected. | Running the job – execute the job on the full set of data according to the provided instructions to produce AI suggestions. | .

Once you added a job, proceed to add a data source to specify the set of golden records the job will operate on. | . Add a data source . A data source within a job refers to a specific set of golden records that the job will operate on. The data source defines the input data for the AI agent, ensuring that the job processes the correct records for a specific task. To add a data source . | On the navigation pane, go to AI Agents (or, Management &gt; AI Agents). | Select the AI agent for which you added the job. Then, select the job. | On the Configuration tab of the job page, in the Data section, select Add data source. | On the Create Data Source pane, do the following: . | Enter a user-friendly Name of the data source. | If you want to limit the number of golden records in the data source, select the Sampling checkbox. Then, in Sampling Size, enter the desired number of records that you want to use. | Use the Modified Since Last Run option to define if the AI agent job should consider only updated records.

Once you added the needed data source, proceed to configure the prompt that the job should follow to complete the task. | . Configure a prompt . A prompt in an AI agent job is a set of instructions or natural language input that tells the AI agent what task to perform and how to perform it on the selected data source. It acts as the core logic of the job, guiding the AI agent’s behavior based on your business goals.

Then, select the job. | On the Configuration tab of the job page, in the Skills section, select the skill that the agent should use to perform the job. | In the Instructions section, enter a prompt instructing the agent what task it must perform. Then, select the data source on which the job should run. To do this, drag the needed data source from the Data section onto the Instructions section. Once you configured the prompt, test the job configuration to make sure that the results meet your expectations and the task is performed correctly. | . Test the job . Testing a job is an important step because it helps achieve the following: . | Ensure the agent performs accurately on a smaller subset of golden records, helping to catch errors early and prevent costly mistakes before processing the full data source. | Validate that the job configuration and instructions align with the expected outcomes. | . When you test the job, no changes are made to the your golden records. The purpose of testing is solely to provide a preview of the results that will be generated when the job is run. To test the job . | On the navigation pane, go to AI Agents (or, Management &gt; AI Agents). | Select the AI agent for which you added the job. Then, select the job. | In the upper-right corner of the job page, select Test Now. The testing process may take some time depending on the amount of data to be processed. | When testing is completed, review the testing results: . | Go to the Runs tab. Locate the job run with the Test label and the time corresponding to when you did the test run. Wait until the test run status is Completed. The layout of the Runs tab changes depending on the skill selected when configuring the prompt. In this example, the images are for the Fix Data Quality Issues skill. | Select the test run. You can now review the preliminary suggestions generated during the test run. The values that the AI agent suggested to change are highlighted in green. If the test run returns no results, try adjusting the job settings as described in Troubleshoot an AI agent job. | To view the AI agent suggestions, locate a cell highlighted in green.

For an extensive set of data with hundreds of thousands or millions of records, use advanced filters to narrow down the number of records in the project to test your configuration. When you are satisfied with the configuration, you can then modify the filters and run the project on the entire set of data. For example, if you want to deduplicate all golden records of the Company business domain, start by narrowing down the companies to a specific country. To do this, apply two filter rules: one to identify all golden records of the Company business domain, and another to find all golden records that match the specific country. This approach allows you to refine your matching rules on a targeted subset of data. When you are satisfied with the configuration, simply remove the filter rule for the specific country and run the project for all golden records of the Company business domain. | Matching functions that you want to use for detecting duplicates. To ensure a faster deduplication process and make it easier to revert merges, create separate projects for equality matching functions and fuzzy matching functions.

This section outlines several limitations of Azure Synapse Analytics, explaining why it may not be the best choice for streaming large sets of data directly from CluedIn. As an alternative, we recommend using One Lake or Azure Data Lake. Not optimized for frequent small updates . Azure Synapse Analytics is a massively parallel processing (MPP) data warehouse designed for handling large-scale, batch-oriented analytical workloads. It is not optimized for frequent, small data updates or transactional workloads. Frequent small updates might lead to inefficient use of resources, data imbalances that impact query performance, and overhead of write operations. High data ingestion costs . Frequent data pushes require the use of data pipelines, storage transactions, and potentially recomputing indexes and materialized views in Synapse. Constant data ingestion using Synapse pipelines can result in high operational costs. In addition, frequent ingestion competes with analytical workloads for resources, reducing overall performance. Latency in Synapse processes . Synapse works best when given time to process large volumes of data, but frequent updates introduce latency at every stage. Loading data into Synapse requires preprocessing, uploading to staging layers, and running COPY commands, which are not instant. In addition, frequent changes to metadata (for example, partitions, indexes) slow down the ingestion process. ",

This section can contain multiple records. | . Both sections consist of many elements that represent various operations, which happened within a logical processing step. The operation is a small and logical computation and typically has a single responsibility. Each operation consists of following information: . | Operation name – name of the operation in the processing pipeline. | Status – indicates the outcome of the operation. The possible statuses include: . | Successful – the operation executed and completed without errors. This status reflects the execution of the operation, not whether it resulted in any changes. An operation may be marked as successful even if no changes were applied—for example, when the input did not require modification. | Successful with warnings – the operation was executed but encountered non-critical issues. | Skipped - the operation was not executed due to specified reason. | Failed - the operation encountered a critical error and did not complete successfully. | . | Duration – the time taken by the operation to execute within the processing pipeline. | Summaries – a tabular representation of actions made by the operation. This summary is derived from events and operations recorded during execution and provides a concise and user-friendly visual overview of outcomes. | Events and Operations – a detailed breakdown of actions made by the operation. These are the primary source of insight into what the operation actually did. Events and operations are also reflected in the summary table for easier interpretation. Note that the information in Summaries and Events and Operations is generally the same; the difference lies in how it is visually presented. In most cases, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two sections. However, in less common cases, some events and operations may not be included in summaries. | . If an operation does not contain Summaries and Events and Operations, it means that no changes were applied during its execution. ",

    "content": "This section helps you interpret the Explain Log by focusing on two key aspects: understanding where golden record values come from and identifying rules applied to a golden record. Understanding where golden record values come from . To see which values are used in the golden record, review the Merge data parts operation in the Golden Record section. The Summaries table within this operation shows each property value along with the ID of the record from which it originated. Once you identify the record ID, you can further investigate the operations that were applied to that specific record throughout the processing pipeline. Identifying rules applied to a golden record . To determine which rules have been applied to a golden record, refer to the Evaluate rules operations in the Golden Record section. You may notice that this section contains two Evaluate rules operations: . | The first Evaluate rules operation is dedicated to survivorship rules. | The second Evaluate rules operation is dedicated to golden record rules. | . The structure of both operations in the Explain Log is the same. Let’s consider an example of the Summaries section for golden record rules. It includes two tables: . | Applied rules – lists all golden record rules along with their actions that were successfully applied to the golden record as well as actions that were skipped or failed. | Evaluated rules – lists all golden record rules along with their actions that exist in the system and indicates whether each rule was applied, partially applied, or skipped. If a rule was skipped, a reason is provided—for example, if the conditions defined in the rule’s action were not met. | . Note that the Golden Record section provides information only about survivorship rules and golden record rules. It does not include information about data part rules.

It includes first-hand advice and labs on building integrations. | Keep integrations focused on fetching data only – not cleaning, access control, or joining/blending data. In ETL terms, CluedIn follows an ELT model: Extract + Load are handled by integrations; Transform is handled by the CluedIn server. | Build crawlers assuming the data structure will change regularly (even if it does not). | Many source systems provide “Discovery Endpoints”, which let you detect what types of data are available to fetch. Using these makes your integration more dynamic and flexible rather than static. With Discovery Endpoints, your integration can identify available objects or datasets and then iterate through them to fetch all rows or instances. These sources often also describe the data in terms of types, constraints, and other metadata, which can further guide your integration logic. | Leverage the inbuilt Crawler Validation Framework within the Crawler Template to ensure your crawler follows best practices. | Design crawlers to handle large datasets (billions of rows). Implement paging, filtering, and retry mechanisms. | Expect to use “Service Accounts” – your crawler may need to iterate across all accounts accessible to that service account. | Be mindful of the default crawler timeout (10 minutes). If a crawler does not fetch data in that window, CluedIn will terminate the job. You can increase this timeout in container.config if needed (for example, for pre-sorting large tables). | . ",

Once you create the mapping and process the data set from the data source synced from Purview, you will receive a notification when the data set is synced back to Purview. To find the asset in Purview . | In the Microsoft Purview portal , navigate to Data Map &gt; Domains. | In your default domain, select the collection that stores the assets from CluedIn. | Select the assets card. | In the list of assets, find and select the asset with the same name as the data set in CluedIn. | On the asset details page, go to Lineage. Here, you can view a visual representation of how a data set moves in the CluedIn processing pipeline. The following screenshot shows the initial data set that has been ingested into CluedIn. The data set is then mapped to standard fields, resulting in clues. Finally, the mapped records (clues) are sent to the processing pipeline. The following screenshot shows the continuation of the lineage from the previous screenshot. As a result of processing, the data set produced golden records of the Account entity type. | . ",

    "content": "On the vocabulary key details page, you can view relevant information about a vocabulary key and take other actions to manage a vocabulary key. Configuration . This tab contains general information about the vocabulary key, including: . | Display name – a user-friendly identifier of the vocabulary key. This name is displayed at the top of the vocabulary details page. | Name – an identifier of the vocabulary key that, together with the key prefix, forms a complete vocabulary key. | Group – a collection that brings together related vocabulary keys, facilitating easier navigation among all keys within the vocabulary. | Visibility settings – a configuration that determines if the vocabulary key is visible in the system. When the toggle is turned off, it means that the vocabulary key is not available in filters, column options in search results page, or golden record properties. While all vocabulary key values are retained in the system, they can only be viewed on the vocabulary key details page. | Data type – a type of data that the vocabulary key can hold. For more information, see Data types. The data type is closely connected with the list of available operators in filters. Depending on the data type assigned to the vocabulary key, the list of operators may differ. For example, the list of operators for a vocabulary key with the Number data type is different from that for a vocabulary key with the Text data type. | Storage type – a type of field—keyword, typed, untyped—where the vocabulary key value is stored. Keyword is generally used for strings. Typed is the default choice for numeric and date-related data types, enabling the use of specific operators in filters (for example, Between, Equals, Greater or Equal). If you change the storage to Untyped, you won’t have access to the specific operators designed for numeric or date-related data types. Nevertheless, you can still use operators available for strings. | Classification – a logical category that makes the vocabulary key easy to search. | Description – a summary that explains the purpose of the vocabulary key. You can add rich formatting to the description, such as bolding, underlining, or italicizing text. | Mapping to another vocabulary key – a section that shows if the current vocabulary key is mapped to another vocabulary key. The purpose of such mapping is to avoid having duplicate values in the system. | . Usage . This tab contains the global view of vocabulary key usage in the system: number of golden records, streams, glossary terms, rules, data set mappings, clean projects, deduplication projects, and saved searches where the vocabulary key is used. You can select the View all button to view more details and find links to the corresponding elements in the system. All values . This tab displays all values associated with the key, along with the total number of golden records in which each value is used. When you select a specific value, a new tab containing the search results will open. This tab lists golden records where the selected vocabulary key value is used. Note that the vocabulary key column is not displayed by default, so you may need to add columns to the search results page. Lineage . This tab shows the transformations of the vocabulary key. | Integrations – data source from which the vocabulary key originates. | Source vocabulary keys – vocabulary key that originates from a specific data source (integration). | Core vocabulary keys – vocabulary key to which the source vocabulary key is mapped. | Streams – streams where the vocabulary key is used. | . Profiling . This tab contains a breakdown and distribution of all vocabulary key values in a graphic format. It can help you identify issues and anomalies in data quality. Profiling is a beta feature. To access profiling, go to Administration &gt; Feature Flags, and enable the Profiling dashboards feature. Profiling is type-specific, so the dashboards for text and number vocabulary keys are different. The following image shows an example of profiling for a text vocabulary key. The profiling for a text vocabulary key contains the following dashboards: . | Total values – the total number of values that the vocabulary key has. | Values over time – a time-series visualization displaying the count of values that appeared in CluedIn over time. The x axis represents the time, and the y axis represents the count of values. For a more granular view, you can select a specific time period using the mouse. | Distribution of values (bar gauge) – the distribution of vocabulary key values based on the number of records where each value is used. Each bar represents a distinct value, with the color gradient indicating the frequency of that value’s occurrence in the records: green indicates a lower number of records, while red indicates a higher number of records. This gradient provides a quick visual cue for identifying the most and least common values. | Distribution of values (pie chart) – the distribution of vocabulary key values based on the number of records where each value is used. Each slice of the pie represents a distinct key value, with the area of the slice indicating the frequency of that value’s occurrence in the records. The larger the slice, the higher the number of records that contain the value. This type of visualization helps to quickly understand the relative proportions of different vocabulary key values. | . The following image shows an example of profiling for a number vocabulary key. The profiling for a number vocabulary key contains the following dashboards: . | Minimum value – the minimum value among all values of a vocabulary key. | Standard deviation – the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It indicates how much individual values deviate from the average value. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the average, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range of values. | Maximum value – the maximum value among all values of a vocabulary key. | Average value – the average value, calculated by dividing the sum of all values by the number of values. This visualization helps to quickly understand the central tendency among the vocabulary key values. | Number of values – the total number of values that the vocabulary key has. | Sum value – the sum of all vocabulary key values. | Values over time – a time-series visualization displaying the count of values that appeared in CluedIn over time. The x axis represents the time, and the y axis represents the count of values. | . Pending changes and Audit log . The Pending changes tab contains tasks for reviewing changes to the vocabulary key submitted by users who are not Vocabulary Owners. The Audit log tab contains a detailed history of changes to the vocabulary key. ",

When the load returns to normal, the extra nodes will be shut down. However, be aware that there are additional infrastructure and licensing costs associated with scaling up. For more information about auto-scaling, contact CluedIn support. You can enable auto-scaling after installation. ",

The terminology and user interface described in this article might be slightly different depending on your version of CluedIn, but the overall logic remains the same. In this article, you will learn how to build an organizational hierarchy to reflect the relations of entities within an organization. We are going to build a hierarchy of the following entities: . | Business Group – the highest-level organizational unit, typically representing a major line of business or a holding structure. It may consist of multiple companies that operate under a shared strategic direction but may have separate operations, finances, and compliance structures. | Company – a legal and financial entity that operates under the business group. It typically has its own set of books for accounting and is responsible for reporting taxes, profits, and losses. | Legal Entity – an organization that has legal standing in the eyes of the law—it can enter contracts, own assets, and be held liable. In many contexts, it is synonymous with a company, but some companies may contain multiple legal entities for operational, tax, or regulatory reasons. | Purchasing Organization – responsible for procurement activities—purchasing goods and services, negotiating terms with vendors, and managing supplier relationships. | Sales Organization – responsible for the sale and distribution of products or services. It defines the selling structure within a company or legal entity, including sales regions, channels, and responsibilities. | Warehouse (or plant) – a warehouse is a specific location, dedicated to the storage and handling of goods; a warehouse is a specific location, often within or attached to a plant, dedicated to the storage and handling of goods. | .

Therefore, we need to create an edge relation between the Purchasing Organization and Legal Entity golden records to represent this connection in the organizational hierarchy. For this purpose, we can use the /PurchasingOrgOf edge type. After processing the data set, we have 2 golden records of the Purchasing Organization business domain. Sales Organization data set . The Sales Organization data set consists of 3 columns: sales_organization_id, sales_organization_name, and legal_entity_id. We mapped this data set to the Sales Organization business domain and the Training Sales Org vocabulary. The legal_entity_id column is used to establish a relationship between a sales organization and its corresponding legal entity. Therefore, we need to create an edge relation between the Sales Organization and Legal Entity golden records to represent this connection in the organizational hierarchy. For this purpose, we can use the /SalesOrgOf edge type. After processing the data set, we have 2 golden records of the Sales Organization business domain. Warehouse data set . The Warehouse data set consists of 3 columns: warehouse_id, warehouse_name, and sales_orgnization_id. We mapped this data set to the Warehouse business domain and the Training Warehouse vocabulary. The sales_orgnization_id column is used to establish a relationship between a warehouse and its corresponding sales organization. Therefore, we need to create an edge relation between the Warehouse and Sales Organization golden records to represent this connection in the organizational hierarchy. For this purpose, we can use the /WarehouseOf edge type. After processing the data set, we have 3 golden records of the Warehouse business domain. Preparation results . After preparing the data sets, you can view the relations between golden records—created using edges—on the Relations tab of a golden record. For example, the following screenshot shows how a company is related to its business group, as well as to the legal entities that are part of the company. To view all organizational relations in one place, create a hierarchy. ",

    "content": "The process of creating a hierarchy involves configuring a hierarchy project and loading entities of specific relation types. Hierarchy project configuration . | Start by creating a hierarchy project. In the first step, you only need to provide the hierarchy name. You do not need to select the business domain because we will rely on the existing edge relations. | Since the relations between golden records already exist in the system, we can use them as the starting for building the hierarchy. We will build the hierarchy from top to bottom, starting with the relations between Business Group and Company. These relations are represented by the /CompanyOf relation type with the Incoming direction. | For the top-level hierarchy project configuration, we rely on the existing relations to Automatically identify top-level golden records. Regarding the hierarchy type configuration, we choose the Single hierarchy project option because there is only one top-level Business Group golden record. As a result, the hierarchy project displays the relations between Business Group and its Companies. Next, we will explain how to load other entities of the organizational hierarchy to the project one by one. | . Building organizational hierarchy . | To build organizational hierarchy, we recommend loading entities using the existing relations. Since we already have the relations between Business Group and its Companies, next we need to display the relations between Companies and their Legal Entities. To do this, load entities that have the /LegalEntityOf relation type with the Incoming direction. As a result, the hierarchy is updated with the Legal Entity golden records. | Next, we need to display the relations between Legal Entities and their Purchasing Organizations. To do this, load entities that have the /PurchasingOrgOf relation type with the Incoming direction. As a result, the hierarchy is updated with the Purchasing Organization golden records. | Next, we need to display the relations between Legal Entities and their Sales Organizations. To do this, load entities that have the /SalesOrgOf relation type with the Incoming direction. As a result, the hierarchy is updated with the Sales Organization golden records. | Finally, we need to display the relations between Sales Organizations and their Warehouses. To do this, load entities that have the /WarehouseOf relation type with the Incoming direction. As a result, the hierarchy is updated with the Warehouse golden records. This is the last level that we needed to add to the hierarchy, and now our hierarchy displays the relations between Business Group, Companies, Legal Entities, Procurement Organizations, Sales Organizations, and Warehouses. | . Hierarchy creation results . After creating a hierarchy, you need to save and publish it. As a result, you can view the hierarchy project on the Hierarchies tab of a golden record that is involved in the hierarchy. Additionally, the hierarchy relations are displayed on the Relations tab of a golden record. To sum up, in this article, we demonstrated how to create an organizational hierarchy using the existing relations between organizational entities within the system. To automate the hierarchy-building process, it is essential to define edge relations during mapping. CluedIn uses these edge relations to efficiently build and manage the organizational hierarchy. ",

Common symptoms include: . | Queues growing indefinitely (messages are piling up but not being processed). | Queues stuck (no new messages are being consumed). | . Services that depend on these messages may experience failures or degraded performance. To check the queues . | Accesing RabbitMQ. Run the following command to get access the RabbitMQ credentials. kubectl get secret cluedin-rabbitmq -n cluedin -o jsonpath=\"{.data.rabbitmq-password}\" | base64 --decode . | RabbitMQ includes a built-in management UI. To access it, you first need to open a port forward to the RabbitMQ pod: . #kubectl port-forward service/cluedin-rabbitmq 15672:15672 -n cluedin . This will return an output similar to the following: . Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:15672 -&gt; 15672 Handling connection for 15672 Handling connection for 15672 Handling connection for 15672 Handling connection for 15672 Handling connection for 15672 Handling connection for 15672 . The RabbitMQ dashboard becomes available at http://localhost:15672. | Sign in to the RabbitMQ UI using the following credentials: . | Username – cluedin. | Password – Retrieve the password from your stored CluedIn credentials. | . | Check the queues. After the sign-in, the system typically directs you to the Overview tab. This dashboard provides a high-level summary of RabbitMQ, including the total number of messages currently in the system and key metrics related to queue activity. | You can sort the queues by total messages to quickly identify the largest queues within RabbitMQ. | You can also review message rates to determine whether queues are processing the messages as expected: . | Incoming – Indicates that messages are being published to the queue by a producer. These messages remain in the queue until they are consumed. | Deliver/Get – Indicates that messages from the queue are being consumed by a consumer. | . If you see a large number of Incoming messages but no corresponding Deliver/Get activity, it may indicate that no consumers are currently available to process those messages. | To check the number of consumers attached to a queue, click the +/– icon on the right-hand side to display the Consumers column. In the example above, the queue RemoteEvents_cluedin-server-processing is connected to a single consumer, with messages delivered at a rate of 224/s. This indicates that the queue is healthy and functioning as expected. | . | . ",

    "content": "Filters can be as simple or complex as you need. Simple filters consist of a single condition or several conditions combined with a logical operator. Complex filters consist of groups of conditions combined with a logical operator. The filter consists of the following elements: . | AND/OR operator – a logical operator that combines conditions expressed within rules or groups (if available). | Group – a container for rules, allowing you to create complex filters by combining multiple conditions. Each group has its own AND/OR operator, which dictates how the conditions within the group are combined. | Rule – a set of parameters that make up a filter condition. It defines what to look for in your data. | . Creating a filter is a step-by-step process in which parameters are defined one after another. The following diagram shows the sequence of defining filter parameters. Property type is a parameter that defines the type of object in CluedIn. There are the following property types: . | Property – a metadata about a golden record. You can find many properties on the golden record details page. For more information, see Properties. | Vocabulary – a schema that contains attributes (vocabulary keys) shared across different golden records. | Glossary – a group of records that meet specific criteria. A glossary is essentially a predefined subquery or a rule that can be combined into another rule to reduce complexity and promote reuse and consistency. | . Object is a parameter that defines a specific element you are filtering on. Operation defines the relationship between filter parameters. The available operations change based on the object’s data type (DateTime, Text, Integer, and so on). For more information, see Operations. Value is a criteria that you use to define the filter results. For example, the following filter will return all records where such Property (object type) as Tag (object) Contains (operation) the value Invalid (criteria). If you want to define several criteria in one filter, you can add more rules to the same filter. For example, the following filter will return all records where such Property (object type) as Tag (object) Contains (operation) the value Invalid or To review (criteria). When adding more rules to the filter, pay attention to the AND/OR operator in the upper-left corner of the filter. Selecting AND will return only those records where all combined criteria match. Selecting OR will return only those records where any of the combined criteria match. ",

When creating a mapping for a data set, you have the option to generate a new vocabulary. CluedIn will then automatically create vocabulary keys and assign data types. You can customize the names of vocabulary keys and data types. Once the mapping is created, you can then open the vocabulary and make additional adjustments to vocabulary keys if needed. | Manually – this option is part of the model-first approach, which assumes that you need to create vocabulary keys before creating the mapping for a data set.

For more information, see Data types. | Review the storage for the vocabulary key. This is the type of field—keyword, typed, untyped—where the vocabulary key value is stored. The storage is selected by default according to the data type. The keyword storage option cannot be changed.

    "content": "The purpose of vocabulary key mapping is to keep data organized and consistent by preventing duplicate values in the system. For the practical application of vocabulary key mapping, check the video in Modeling approaches. To demonstrate the importance and efficiency of vocabulary key mapping, let’s look at an example. Suppose you have contact records coming into CluedIn from various sources—Salesforce, SAP, and MS SQL Server—and each source has its unique vocabulary. Some properties in data coming from these sources are the same, and some are different. For example, the gender property exists in data from all three sources. It means that gender values would be stored in three separate vocabulary keys. To keep all gender values under one vocabulary key instead of keeping them in each separate vocabulary key, you can map these three vocabulary keys to one, thus improving the organization and getting better visibility of your data. To map one vocabulary key to another . | Open the vocabulary key that you want to map to another vocabulary key. | In the upper-right corner of the vocabulary key details page, select Edit. | In the Maps to section, select Add mapping. | Find and select a vocabulary key to which you want to map the current vocabulary key. Then, select Add Key. | Select Confirm. | Select Save, and then confirm your choice. The Mapped label appears under the vocabulary key name. Hover over the label to find the vocabulary key to which the current vocabulary key is mapped. | . The vocabulary key mapping is executed on the clue level, so the History of the golden record does not show source and target properties. However, you can view the source and target properties in the Explain Log of the golden record (Records &gt; data source &gt; Translate properties &gt; Summaries). When you try to use a vocabulary key that is mapped to another vocabulary key, a prompt will inform you of the mapping. Throughout the system, the following guidelines are applied to mapped vocabulary keys: . | When you use a vocabulary key in rules, streams, glossary terms, or anywhere else in the system, and it is mapped to another vocabulary key, the values from the mapped vocabulary key will be used. Essentially, the system takes the left-most vocabulary key and returns the values from the right-most vocabulary key. For example, if vocabulary key A is mapped to vocabulary key B, and vocabulary key B is mapped to vocabulary key C, then when you use vocabulary key A in the filter rule, the values from the vocabulary key C will be returned. | When you request a specific vocabulary key for display purposes and it is mapped to another vocabulary key, the values from the source vocabulary key will be used. However, because the source vocabulary key is mapped, all its values are stored in the mapped vocabulary key, meaning you won’t see any values for the source vocabulary key. For example, if you add a vocabulary key column to the search results page, it will be empty because all values are stored in the mapped vocabulary key. | When you make changes to the current vocabulary key mapping or to the vocabulary key it is mapped to, the system will evaluate whether these changes are compatible with the vocabulary key configuration. | .

The formula action is not available in survivorship rules. | Golden record rules – formulas are available in filters and actions (conditions and formula action). | . In CluedIn, a Power Fx formula requires a context to work with. It is called an Entity, and it represents a data part or a golden record. Essentially, it is a global variable that holds a sandboxed version of a data part or a golden record in CluedIn. Consider the following example of a formula. Right(Entity.Name, 1) = \"t\" . This formula consists of the following elements: . | Right – a built-in function that retrieves the rightmost x characters in a string. | Entity – a context that the formula is working against. | Name – a string property of Entity. | 1 – the number of characters to retrieve from the right end of the string. | = \"t\" – the equality evaluator that checks if the retrieved character is equal to the letter “t”. | . The formula checks if the rightmost character of Entity.Name is t. If it is, the formula returns true, meaning that the rule will be applied to a specific golden record. If the formula returns false, the rule will not be applied to a specific golden record. Custom functions . Custom CluedIn functions are designed to help you with querying and setting data for a data part or a golden record.

    "content": "AI agents examine incoming data and provide suggestions based on configured prompts. These suggestions are not automatically applied to the golden records. Instead, you must review each suggestion and decide whether to apply or reject it. In this article, you will learn how to interpret, validate, and take action based on the outputs generated by AI agents. You need to review the results of AI agent jobs that use the following skills: . | Create Rules . | Fix Data Quality Issues . | . For the Find Duplicates skill, AI agent suggestions are approved automatically. This avoids a two-tier approval process, because matches within a deduplication project already require user approval. Your administrator can enable the automatic approval of AI agent suggestions. When this setting is turned on, you do not need to approve any results, regardless of the AI agent skill. This article explains how to manage final suggestions generated by an AI agent. For details on how to view test run results, see Test an AI agent job. To review the results returned by an AI agent . | On the navigation pane, go to AI Agents (or, alternatively, Management &gt; AI Agents). | Select the AI agent whose results you want to review, and then choose the job of interest. | On the job page, go to the Results tab. Here you can view the list of all suggestions generated by the AI agent. If the Results tab is empty, this may mean the following: . | Your administrator enabled the auto-approval of AI agent suggestions. In this case, all suggestions become approved as soon as the agent provides them. To view approved suggestions, in the status filter, select Approved. | All suggestions from the AI agent were already approved or rejected (by you or another user). | The AI agent job is still running or was not run at all. If the job is still running, you will see a progress bar at the top of the AI agent job page. To check if the job was run before, go to the Runs tab. If the job was run at least once (not in test mode), you will see at least one record with the Completed status and without the Test label. | . You can also view AI agent suggestions on the Runs tab. However, you cannot approve or reject them from that tab. The layout of the Runs tab changes depending on the skill selected when configuring the prompt. In the example above, the image is for the Fix Data Quality Issues skill. | (Optional) Filter the suggestions by business domain or suggestion status (pending, approved, or rejected). Select the Pending status if you want to approve and reject the suggestions. | Review each suggestion. Depending on the review result, do one of the following: . | If the suggestion is correct and you want to apply the suggested changes, next to the suggestion, select Approve. The AI agent makes the suggested change to the golden record; information about this change is recorded in the golden record history. | If the suggestion is incorrect or not necessary, next to the suggestion, select Reject. | To accept or reject all suggestions, in the upper-left corner of the Results tab, select Approve All or Reject All. | To accept or reject specific suggestions only, select these suggestions. Then, in the upper-right corner of the Results tab, open the three-dot menu, and then select Approve or Reject. | . Once a suggestion is approved or rejected, its status changes accordingly (to Approved or Rejected). You can find this suggestion by selecting Approved or Rejected in the status filter. | After you run the job, the AI agent may not immediately produce all expected suggestions. The recommended approach is to work iteratively – run the job, review the results, then run the job and review the results again. Repeat this process until the AI agent generates all expected suggestions. | . ",

You can select the existing value or create a new value. Use this action when the vocabulary key doesn’t contain any value. | . | Add Value with CluedIn AI | Adds a value to the property or vocabulary key according to your prompt. For example, you can check if the email address in the record is a personal address or business address. | . | Change Business Domain | Changes the business domain of the record. You can select the existing business domain or create a new business domain. | . | Copy Value | Copies the value from one field (source field) to another (target field). | . | Delete Value | Deletes the value that you select. | . | Evaluate Regex | Finds values that match a regular expression and replaces them with the needed value. | . | Formula Action (Power Fx) | Runs a Power Fx expression in the rule to compute values, evaluate conditions, or call CluedIn custom functions (for example, AddTag, GetVocabularyKeyValue, SetEntityProperty, SetVocabularyKeyValue). Use this to set vocabulary keys, transform strings, perform type conversions, and make decisions. | . | Mask Value | Applies a mask to the value. You can use this action to hide sensitive data.

    "content": "Suppose you want to tag golden records that contain invalid emails with “Invalid email”. Let’s start from a golden record that is built from one data part from the CRM source. The data part contains an email property with invalid value (jsmith&amp;cluedin.com). At this point, it does not matter if you use a data part rule or a golden record rule to tag records with invalid email because the golden record contains just one data part. If we use a data part rule, the golden record that contains invalid email will be tagged with “Invalid email”. As long as the golden record contains just one data part, the above setup is correct. However, what if the golden record contains multiple data parts, each with its own email property? Suppose we add another data part from a different source (ERP) to the golden record. This data part also contains the email property, but it has a valid value (jsmith@cluedin.com). At this point, we also add a survivorship rule that tells CluedIn to use the property from the ERP source in the golden record. As a result, the golden record contains a valid email from the data part of the ERP source, but it is still tagged with “Invalid email”. This is because the data part rule is applied to each data part of the golden record, even if the properties from a specific data part are not used in the golden record due to a survivorship rule. To avoid irrelevant tags in golden records, use golden record rules for tagging data quality issues. The golden record rules take into account only the properties of the golden record, not the properties of its specific data parts.

Now that we’ve identified an invalid email, we can add a data part rule to replace invalid email with a valid one in data parts from the CRM source. When the email in the data part is replaced with a valid value, the previous data part rule that tagged invalid emails becomes irrelevant and the “Invalid email” tag disappears from the golden record. Next, we add another data part from a different source—ERP. This data part contains invalid email (jsmith&amp;cluedin.com). In this example, we are not using a custom survivorship rule. Instead, we rely on default survivorship mechanism, which picks the most recent value for the golden record. Since the ERP data part appeared after the CRM data part, it is used in the golden record. As a result, the golden record contains invalid email address, but it is not tagged with “Invalid email”. This is because the data part is applied only to data parts from the CRM source, it is not targeted at data parts from the ERP source. To make sure that invalid emails are flagged regardless of the source, use a golden record rule instead of the data part rule. The golden record rule is executed based on the properties of the golden record. As a result, the “Invalid email” tag is added to the golden record because the email property used in the golden record is invalid. ",

In this article, you will learn what a golden record is, how it is generated, and how you can control the sources contributing to a golden record. A golden record is an accurate and consolidated representation of a data subject, such as an organization or an employee, derived from multiple sources. It provides a 360-degree view of a data subject, facilitating a deeper understanding of its current state and the reasons behind it. A golden record is created through a process of data integration, enrichment, cleaning, deduplication, and manual data entry. Each step in the process is registered as a separate element called a data part. A golden record is usually made up of multiple data parts. The purpose of creating a golden record is to provide a single source of truth, ensuring data consistency, improving data quality, and enabling better decision-making. A golden record serves as a reliable reference point that can be used by different systems, departments, or stakeholders within the organization. Golden records in CluedIn are stored for performance reasons, but essentially, they are a projection of all the sources and rules that you have created. That is why golden records adapt based on the changes that are applied within CluedIn. This makes golden records very agile—you can easily revert changes and re-shape your golden records at any point in time. ",

Golden records can have 2 types of relations: . | Linking similar records together. | Linking golden records together. | . Linking similar records together . In CluedIn, similar records are grouped together under the same banner called golden record. Generally, the golden record is composed of records from multiple sources. For example, suppose we have a golden record that is composed of 2 records from different sources: one record from CRM and the other record from ERP. These distinct nodes are referred to as data parts. The more sources you add, the bigger your golden record model becomes. Since the golden record is a projection of the sources, adding or removing a source is not an issue. This is what gives great flexibility of golden records in CluedIn. Linking golden records together . We always say that a golden record is a graph of a graph. What it means is that when the golden record is being produced, CluedIn has the ability to link golden records together using edges. An edge is simply a relation. You can define an edge using rules or during the mapping. When you define an edge, CluedIn can connect golden records together as shown in the example. So, when we say that a golden record is a graph of a graph, it is because at the end, the entire view of the models is as follows. ",

    "content": "To make the golden record generation process easier to understand, we’ll start with the simplified explanation that does not include various types of rules. We’ll focus on the records and use the concepts of bronze, silver, and golden layers from the medallion architecture for visual assistance. | Medallion architecture term | CluedIn term | Definition | . | Bronze layer | Source record | This is a record in its basic, raw format as it was in the source system. | . | Silver layer | Data part | This is a mapped record with all of the pre-processing rules and changes applied to it. | . | Golden layer | Golden record | This is a record that you can trust, usually formed by aggregating data parts to the existing golden record. | . Generally, a new record is associated with the bronze layer. This is the record that comes from a specific source—it may come from a file, an Azure Data Factory pipeline, or a database. We call this record a source record. The process of generating a golden record spans from source records, through data parts, to the golden record. Next, we’ll describe each step that the record goes through to become a new golden record or aggregate into the existing golden record. Source record (bronze) . A source record is a raw record that has been ingested into CluedIn from a source system. It is generally stored in JSON format. Such record has not been modified in any way. You can see source records on the Preview tab of the data set. Data part (silver) . When records appear in CluedIn, you need to add a semantic layer to transform them into a format that CluedIn can understand. This process is called mapping. Once all the steps of the mapping process have been performed, you get what we call a data part. Essentially, a data part is an aggregation of all changes to the record coming from a single source after it has been mapped. During the mapping process, the source records can go through multiple steps: . | Changes to the values of mapped records via property rules. | Changes to the mapped records via pre-process rules. | Changes to mapped records via advanced mapping code. | If the mapped record gets into the quarantine, it should be approved to get to the next stage. | . All in all, a data part is a record in a format that CluedIn can understand and that has already gone through multiple processes to ensure it is valid and ready for the production of a golden record. Golden record (golden) . When you process the data set, CluedIn checks if the data part can be associated with the existing golden record. If the data part can be associated with the existing golden record—they share the same identifiers—then it is aggregated to the existing golden record. In this case, the golden record is re-processed. If the data part cannot be associated with the existing golden record, then a new golden record is created. What happens when golden record is re-processed? . When a new data part is added to the existing golden record, CluedIn incorporates all of its properties into the golden record. However, conflicts can arise between new and existing data parts when the values for the same property differ. We describe the scenarios of handling different values for the same property later in this article. How can you re-shape a golden record? . Depending on the projects and processes that are running in CluedIn—clean projects, deduplication projects, enrichers, manual modifications, data ingestion—the golden record can be changed. For example, if you create a clean project and it affects a golden record, a new data part is added to that golden record. Similarly, if you have an enricher that affects a golden record, a new data parts with the properties from third-party source is added to the golden record. If you are not satisfied with the changes made to a golden record by a specific data part, you can simply delete such data part. Whenever a new data part or changes to an existing data part appear in CluedIn, they are ordered by the sort date. The sort date is determined by selecting the first available date among modified, created, and discovery dates: . | If there is a modified date, then this date is used as the sort date. | If there is no modified date, but there is a created date, then this date is used as the sort date. | If there is no modified or created date, then the discovery date is used as the sort date. The discovery date is always present in the data part as it is the date when the data part was created in CluedIn. | . The sort date is important because CluedIn uses it by default to determine the winning value for each specific data part, as well as the winning value between different data parts. We’ll explain the specifics of this mechanism in the following sections. ",

    "content": "In CluedIn, we track the lineage of source records with the help of version branches. Each source has its own version branch that consists of parts. Whenever the source record is changed, a new part is added to the corresponding version branch. This way you can track the changes of values per source. The parts within a version branch are ordered by sort date. The values from the part with the most recent sort date are used in the data part that can contribute to the golden record. To explain how a golden record is built, we’ll start from the way CluedIn handles changes in source records for a golden record with just one source. Then, we’ll move on to discussing a golden record built from multiple sources. One source . Let’s consider a simple example of a golden record that is formed by one data part from CRM. Whenever the source record is changed, a new part appears in the version branch of the corresponding source. In case of conflicting values for the same property—in our case, Job Title—CluedIn takes the value from the part with the most recent sort date and uses this value in a data part. Multiple sources . Now, let’s consider an example of a golden record formed from multiple sources. In this case, each source has its own version branch, and each version branch behaves the same way as described in the section above. However, if there is a property that has different values in each source, then how does CluedIn determine which value should be used in the golden record? The answer is by applying a default survivorship rule. The default survivorship rule is CluedIn’s mechanism for determining the winning value among conflicting values from different sources. According to this rule, manually added changes are prioritized; otherwise, the most recent value wins. To explain how CluedIn determines the winning value among data parts, we’ll use an example of a golden record that is formed from two data parts: one from CRM and the other one from ERP. Each data part has its own version branch that contains a collection of parts. From the section above, you already know how the winning value is defined for a data part. Now, let’s find out how CluedIn defines the winner between data parts. In our example, each data part has a different value for the same property—Job Title. To determine the winning value, CluedIn defines the winner between version branches. It is important to emphasize that CluedIn does not evaluate each part from the version branch individually. CluedIn only evaluates the values from each data part. The value from the data part with the most recent sort date wins and is used in the golden record. The following gif animates the previous diagram, illustrating how the golden record is changed according to default survivorship rule. If the default survivorship rule is not suitable for you, you can set up your own strategy for defining the winning value using survivorship rules. For example, you can create a custom survivorship rule to prioritize a specific source for determining the value for a specific property. Suppose you want CRM to be the source of truth for the Job Title property. In this case, even though the value from ERP is the most recent one, the golden record uses the value from CRM as defined by the custom survivorship rule. The following gif animates the previous diagram, illustrating how the golden record is changed according to custom survivorship rule. ",

Fully local (on-premises or private infrastructure) . | CluedIn is deployed within an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environment that hosts multiple Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes. | One of these containers runs Ollama, an open-source product that allows hosting open-source LLMs such as Phi, Llama, Mistral, and others. | CluedIn comes pre-installed with 8 open-source LLMs, ranging from 1 billion to 8 billion parameters. These smaller models are useful for local inference but are not equivalent in performance or quality to hosted models. | The value of this approach is that all communication between CluedIn and the LLM occurs within the Kubernetes environment. Therefore, no data is sent to a third-party service, not even to Microsoft Azure. | . Azure AI Foundry (controlled cloud environment) . Azure AI Foundry supports over 11,000 models, though CluedIn currently supports chat/completion-based LLMs only. It is recommended to use GPT models, as they are the most tested and widely used with CluedIn.

Human-In-The-Loop (HITL): . By default, every suggestion must be explicitly reviewed and approved by a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL). Approval actions are recorded in the audit log, including: . | Which AI agent proposed the action | Which human user approved and executed it | What decision was taken | . Auto-approval of AI suggestions: . CluedIn provides an optional setting that allows organizations to automatically approve AI suggestions without manual HITL review.

An AI agent can only read data explicitly provided to it. The agent cannot access data of its own volition. End users have an open canvas where they can enter their own prompts. However, strict, deterministic guardrails ensure that AI agents can only read data they have been explicitly granted access to, nothing more.

Not all data parts are considered billable records. The data parts that appeared from the following processes are not billable records: . | Enrichment | Clean projects | User input (editing properties manually) | Shadow entities | Any updates to the source record | . Every time a golden record is processed, the count of billable records is recalculated. If you remove records from CluedIn, the count of billable records would go down as it is recalculated. Each record that you ingest and process from your source counts as a billable record. If 2 records come from the same source and share the same identifier (primary identifier and origin) then they are considered exact duplicates and are merged into one golden record. This is 1 billable record. If 2 similar records come from different sources and are identified as duplicates, they are also merged into 1 golden record, but they will be counted as 2 billable records. If 2 unique records come from the same or different sources, then 2 golden records are created. Therefore, there are 2 data parts, which means that there are 2 billable records. When you ingest a record for the first time, a unique primary identifier is created in the mapping to identify this record once processed. If you later change the value that was used to create the primary identifier in the golden record and re-ingest the original record with the updated value, this will be considered as 2 data parts, resulting in 2 billable records. This is because CluedIn perceives the identifier that was initially created during the mapping as different from the updated record. ",

Street address normalization . Street address normalization converts input addresses into standardized versions before comparing them to identify duplicates. For example, let’s consider two addresses: 123 Fantasy strabe and 123 Fantasy street. When street address normalization is selected, any time CluedIn sees strabe, strasse, street, or str, it turns it into [STR]. If the only thing that differs in an address is the way street is spelled, then the addresses will match. | Input | Normalized version | . | strabe, strasse, street, str\\.?, st | [STR] | . | Allee, aly | [ALY] | . | Boulevard, BLVD | [BLVD] | . | Lane, Ln | [LANE] | . | Drive, Dr | [DRIVE] | . | avenue, ave | [AVE] | . | University, univ | [UNIVERSITY] | . | West, w | [WEST] | . | North, n | [NORTH] | . | East, e | [EAST] | . | South, s | [SOUTH] | . | Floor, flr | [FLOOR] | . | First, 1st | [1ST] | . | Second, 2nd, 2rd | [2ND] | . | Third, 3rd | [3RD] | . | Fourth, 4th | [4TH] | . | Fifth, 5th | [5TH] | . | p\\.?\\s*o\\.?\\s+box, post\\s*box, post\\s*boks, GPO\\s*Box | [POBOX] | . | Private\\sbag, Locked\\sBag, Private\\sMail\\sBag, Locked\\sBag, PMB | [PMB] | . | Plaza, PLAZ, PLZ | [PLZ] | . | Suite, STE | [STE] | . | Trailer, TRLR | [TRLR] | . | Apartment, APT | [APT] | . | Basement, BSMT | [BSMT] | . | Building, BLDG | [BLDG] | . | Department, DEPT | [DEPT] | . | Hanger, HNGR | [HNGR] | . | Lobby, LBBY | [LBBY] | . | Lower, LOWR | [LOWR] | . | Office, OFC | [OFC] | . | Penthouse, PH | [PH] | . | Space, SPC | [SPC] | . | Level, LVL | [LEVEL] | . | Highway, Highwy, Hiway, Hiwy, Hway, Hwy | [HWY] | .

The Lookup data type provides an effective way to implement and manage reference data in CluedIn. Reference data consists of standardized, stable values used to classify or categorize other types of data. Common examples of reference data include country codes, currency codes, units of measurement, industry types, or product categories. The process of creating a vocabulary key of the Lookup data type consists of the following steps: . | Adding reference data to CluedIn . | Creating a glossary term that lists all reference data values that can be used in a vocabulary key of the Lookup data type. | Changing the data type of the vocabulary key and associating it with the relevant glossary term. | .

In this article, we’ll explore two options for adding reference data: uploading a file and creating a manual data entry project. Note that the processing of reference data ingested from a database or an ingestion endpoint follows the same steps as file-based ingestion. Upload a file with reference data . If you have a file with reference data that you want to use in your project, you can upload it to CluedIn. Once the file is uploaded, map it to standard fields. When creating mapping for the data set, make sure you use a business domain and a vocabulary that represent the concept of your reference data. For more information about getting your data into CluedIn, see Getting started with data ingestion. In this article, we’ll use the example of the currency reference data. We mapped the reference data to the Currency business domain and the ProjectCurrency vocabulary. After processing the data set, we have a certain number of valid currency records. These represent all the currencies permitted for use in the project. To add these currencies to the vocabulary key of the Lookup data type, first create a glossary category, and then define a term under that category to represent the currency list. Create a manual data entry project . If you do not have the existing reference data that you can ingest to CluedIn, you can create reference data records with the help of a manual data entry project. First, create a manual data entry project using the business domain and a vocabulary that represent the concept of your reference data. Then, add the form fields for entering the reference data. For example, if you want to enter currency reference data, you can add two fields: ID and Name. Finally, add the currency reference records manually one by one in the manual data entry project.

For example, suppose you have a trainingcompany.currency vocabulary key used in golden records. You can configure this vocabulary key to the Lookup data type so that users can select values from the predefined currency list, ensuring consistency and accuracy. To do this, edit the vocabulary key, change the data type to Lookup, and then select the glossary term that contains the list of allowed values. After saving changes, the vocabulary key is reprocessed and its data type is changed. As a result, 3 computed keys are added to the golden record that contains a vocabulary key of the Lookup data type: Entity Code, Entity ID, and Name. These computed keys are parts of the lookup vocabulary key. You may notice these keys on the search results page, on the golden record Overview page, in the data catalog, and in filters in some places of the platform. Note that at time of processing a rule, the -Entity Code part of the lookup vocabulary key is the only property available, not the -Name or the -Entity ID. So, if you are trying to do comparisons across two lookup vocabulary keys, then you must use the -Entity Code to do the comparison. When lookup reference data is changed or updated, it will be automatically reflected anywhere the vocabulary key of the Lookup data type is used. This means that you do not need to take any additional actions after modifying reference data. When you try to edit the currency property in a golden record, you can select a currency from the predefined list, but you cannot create a new currency value. If the currency is not in the glossary term, it will be marked as an invalid value. To fix this, edit the property and select the value from the predefined list.

    "title": "Example of using countries reference data",
    "content": "Let’s consider an example of using the countries reference data in scenarios where a country can be represented in multiple formats—such as a 2-letter code, 3-letter code, or the full country name. In this case, the lookup vocabulary key serves not only to retrieve the standardized value from the list, but also to ensure the appropriate display of the full country name wherever the country reference is used. For example, instead of displaying a code like US, the system would use the lookup to show United States of America. To illustrate this example, we’ll use company records. Notice the Country column, which contains various formats for referring to a country—such as two-letter codes, three-letter codes, and full country names. To ensure consistency and use standardized values for countries, we need to add and configure the country reference data accordingly. The first step is to add reference data to CluedIn—a list of countries that includes the following columns: ID, DisplayName, TwoLetter, ThreeLetter, and Population. This reference data captures multiple formats for referring to a country, allowing CluedIn to recognize and standardize country values across different representations. We mapped the reference data to the Country business domain and the ProjectCountry vocabulary. Next, we need to review the mapping details on the Map Entity tab and make several changes: . | In the General Details section, in the Entity Name dropdown field, select the vocabulary key that contains the full name of the country (DisplayName). | In the Identifiers section, add the following properties for generating additional identifiers: DisplayName, TwoLetter, ThreeLetter. This allows CluedIn to recognize and resolve country references expressed in any of these formats. When CluedIn encounters a country reference—whether as a two-letter code, three-letter code, or full name—it will match it against the appropriate identifier and return the corresponding value from the DisplayName property, ensuring that the full country name is displayed consistently. Make sure to use a custom origin (for example, country) when generating these identifiers to maintain proper context. | . Once the mapping is complete, process the data set and create a glossary term to represent the list of countries. Ensure the glossary is activated so that its values can be used as allowed options in vocabulary keys that use the Lookup data type. The values from the Name column in the glossary will then be available for selection in a dropdown list wherever the vocabulary key is applied. Once the glossary term containing the list of acceptable countries is ready, the next step is to configure the vocabulary key that should be linked to this country list (for example, trainingcompany.country). To do this, edit the vocabulary key, change its data type to Lookup, and select the appropriate glossary term that contains the allowed country values. After saving the changes, the vocabulary key is reprocessed and its data type is updated accordingly. As a result, the Lookup Data vocabulary is added to the company golden record Overview page, reflecting the country value selected through the lookup vocabulary key. This ensures that the golden record includes standardized, structured information about the associated country, based on the predefined list from the glossary. The initial two-letter and three-letter country codes have been changed to the full country name. To sum up, when working with reference data that includes multiple formats for referring to the same entity—such as country codes and names—you can use a Lookup vocabulary key to standardize these references. For example, a country like Australia might be represented by several valid country names: AU, AUS, or Australia. The Lookup vocabulary key will attempt to resolve the reference by cycling through all available identifiers—including the two-letter code, three-letter code, and full country name. This approach ensures flexible and accurate matching against the standardized country list. The same approach can be applied to currency reference data, where values such as currency codes (for example, USD, EUR) and names (for example, US Dollar, Euro) are resolved through a Lookup vocabulary key to maintain consistency and accuracy across records.

To get better visibility into what is happening with your records, in addition to monitoring, use system healthchecks. You can find them in the upper-right corner of CluedIn.

    "content": "In a data set created from an ingestion endpoint, the Monitoring tab consists of three areas: . | Overview . | Ingestion reports . | Ingestion anomalies . | . Overview . The Overview area contains general statistics about the records and queues described in Common monitoring elements. Ingestion reports . The Ingestion reposts area contains information about each request sent to the specific ingestion endpoint in CluedIn. This information is presented in a table that consists of the following columns: . | ReceiptID – unique identifier of a request. Each request you send to an ingestion endpoint in CluedIn, whether successful or not, has a unique receipt ID. This ID allows you to quickly locate the request report in CluedIn. Simply copy the receipt ID from the request response and paste it to the search box above the table. To view the records that were sent to CluedIn in that specific request, select the receipt ID. As a result, the records appear in the Ingested records pane. Alternatively, you can copy the receipt ID, go to the Preview tab, paste the receipt ID in the search box, and start to search. As a result, only the records sent in a specific request will be displayed on the page. | Received – the number of records received by CluedIn. If the number is 0, it means that the request contained errors and CluedIn rejected it. | Loaded – the number of records loaded into CluedIn. This column contains three categories: . | Success – the number of records that were successfully loaded into CluedIn. | Failed – the number of records that failed to load into CluedIn. | Retry – the number of records that attempted to reload into CluedIn. | . | Logs – the number of logs generated for a specific request. You can view the log details by selecting the content of the cell. Keep in mind that for ingestion endpoints, we only log warnings. These logs are the same as those found on the Logs tab of the dataset. The difference is that the Logs tab contains logs for all requests, while the Ingestion reports table provides logs for each specific request. For more information on how to read logs, see the Logs documentation. | Processed – the number of times the records from a specific request have been processed in CluedIn. | Created at – the timestamp indicating when the ingestion report was generated. This corresponds to the time when the HTTP request was executed. | Produced golden records – the golden records generated from a specific request or those to which records from the request were aggregated as data parts. To view a list of golden records produced from a specific request, select View ingested records. As a result, the golden records appear in the Produced golden records pane. | Actions – currently, this column provides the possibility to remove records—golden records or data parts that were aggregated to the existing golden records—produced from a specific request. If you want to remove the records produced from a specific request, select Remove records. In the confirmation dialog, you can select the checkbox to remove the source records from the temporary storage on the Preview tab. To confirm your choice, enter DELETE, and then start the removal process. Once the records are removed, they will no longer be displayed when you select View ingested records for a specific request. The records removal mechanism is similar to the one described in Remove records, with the difference being that the article describes removing all records produced from the data set, while you have the option to remove records produced from a specific request that contributes to the data set. | . Ingestion anomalies . The Ingestion anomalies area contains a list of potential errors that can occur with the data set, along with remediation steps and the status for each error. This area provides a quick and easy way to monitor the data set for any problems, ensuring you have complete visibility. If you notice that the status of any error indicates a problem, refer to the remediation steps. The following table contains the list of errors and remediation steps. You can find a similar table on the Monitoring tab in CluedIn. | Error name | Remediation | . | Error in logsThis can occur due to various elements, generally data-related. For example, an invalid field name in the record or an unsupported value for a given data type. | Go to the Logs tab and filter the logs by the Error level. Then, select a log to view the detailed reason for the error. | . | Loading failureThis can occur when the search databases are under heavy load. | Go to the Preview tab. You should see the Retry button there. Select the Retry button to attempt reloading your records. If this does not resolve the issue, please reach out to our support team. | . | Error in submissionsThis can occur when the CluedIn processing pipeline is under intense load and cannot handle all the incoming requests. | Go to the Process tab. You should see the Retry button for the submission in the Error state. Select the Retry button to attempt processing your records. If this does not resolve the issue, please reach out to our support team. | . | Ingestion consumer lostIngestion consumer is used to ingest any payload sent to CluedIn. If the ingestion consumer is lost, it means that CluedIn will not ingest any new records. | CluedIn has a self-healing mechanism that checks if a consumer exists for a queue every 5 minutes.

    "title": "Eventual connectivity",
    "content": "The eventual connectivity pattern is at the heart of CluedIn. This pattern of integration makes it simple to blend data from many different systems into a unified and connected data set. Example . Let’s explore the concept of eventual connectivity in CluedIn through an example. We have a golden record that mentions an email address. This email address indicates that there might be another data set where the email is also used. So, CluedIn creates a shadow entity, which acts as a placeholder, with the email address. This shadow entity may have several codes, one of which is built using the email address. At this point, the document golden record is related to the shadow entity. When a new record containing the same email address appears in the system, CluedIn recognizes matching emails, and replaces the shadow entity with a new golden record. In the end, the document record is now related to another golden record, and not to the shadow entity. Goal of eventual connectivity . The goal of eventual connectivity is not to model your data into a final form but to provide a flexible model inferred from the source systems. This means that you don’t have control over the modelling within CluedIn up-front, but you will have control later in the process. You won’t have to conduct long and tedious architecture meetings to discuss how different systems will connect with each other. The eventual connectivity pattern will do the blending of data for you, as long as you can instruct it and guide it using its underlying concepts. Underlying concepts . | Identifiers – universally unique identifiers of a record. Read more about identifiers here. | Edges – a way to instruct CluedIn that there is a reference from one object to another. Edges are the key behind the eventual connectivity pattern. Read more about edge here. | Shadow entities (also known as floating edges) – records that are constructed from edges, with the expectation that the system will eventually find a link between these records. | Aliases – a way to instruct CluedIn that there is a property that can fuzzily lead to a linkage between golden records. | Vocabularies – a way to map properties from the source system to a common vocabulary that CluedIn understands. The vocabularies are key to bridge data across systems. For more information, see a video about vocabulary key mapping here. | . Main advantage . The main advantage of the eventual connectivity pattern is that you can take one system or even one object within a system at a time, determine the codes, aliases, and edges for an object, and then let the pattern manage how everything will blend together. It is also important to remember that with edges, we do not expect you to know where the reference is pointing to. Rather we would ask you to instruct us that a particular field or column should point to another record. This record could be in the current system, or it could be in another system all together. ",

    "content": "In this article, you will learn about the features in CluedIn that you can turn on or off as needed. Since not all features are suitable for every business use case, they are stored separately in Administration &gt; Feature Flags. This allows you to turn on only those features that are most relevant to your needs. However, you are free to try out any feature and see how it works for yourself. Turning on these features is safe and will not cause any disruptions to your data or affect the stability of your instance of CluedIn. If you encounter any issues or do something wrong while using these features, remember that you can always revert your actions. Each feature has a status to indicate the state of the feature’s readiness for production. The following table provides a description of each feature status. | Feature status | Description | . | Deprecated | The feature is no longer recommended for use, and it will be eventually removed in future versions. | . | Development | The feature is in the process of development. It has been tested but not yet validated. You can turn on such feature only in the test environment.

You can find this value in the Overview section of app registration. | ClientSecret – confidential string used by your OneLake app to authenticate itself to the Microsoft identity platform. You can find this value in the Certificates &amp; secrets section of app registration. | TenantID – unique identifier for your Microsoft Entra tenant. You can find this value in the Overview section of app registration. | Enable Stream Cache (Sync mode only) – when stream cache is enabled, CluedIn caches the golden records at intervals, and then writes out accumulated data to one file (JSON, Parquet, or CSV).

    "content": "Profiling allows you to analyze the uploaded records, identify issues and anomalies, and ensure data quality. By detecting inconsistencies and errors early, you can take corrective actions to improve the accuracy and reliability of your data. On the Preview tab, there are two types of profiling: . | Profiling for data set . | Profiling for golden records . | . Profiling for data set . Profiling for the data set allows you to analyze key metrics for each column of the uploaded records and identify data gaps, errors, and overall quality issues. By analyzing data set profiling, you can better understand the source records, evaluate their quality, and make informed decisions for mapping. To view data set profiling . | Find the column for which you want to view data set profiling. In the column header, open the three-dot menu, and then and select View profiling for data set. The Key metrics pane opens, where you can view the details about column values. | . The key data set profiling metrics include the following: . | Number of values – the total number of source records that have a value in a given column. | Number of empty values – the total number of source records that have an empty value in a given column. | Completeness – the percentage of non-empty or non-null values in a given column. | Incompleteness – the percentage of empty or null values in a given column. | Cardinality – the number of unique values in a given column. | Redundancy – the number that represents the frequency with which unique values are repeated in a given column. | . By analyzing data set profiling metrics, you can quickly identify if a particular column contains empty fields. Once aware of this issue, you can fix it by providing the necessary values as described in Modify source records. In general, a high percentage of incompleteness and a large number of repeated values may indicate that the field is not a good choice for producing identifiers. Profiling for golden records . Profiling for golden records provides a breakdown and distribution of all vocabulary key values in a graphic format. It can help you identify issues and anomalies in data quality. Profiling is not limited to a data set, meaning that it displays information about vocabulary key values coming from different data sources. To access profiling for golden records, go to Administration &gt; Feature Flags, and enable the Profiling dashboards feature. To view profiling . | Find the column for which you want to view golden record profiling. In the column header, open the three-dot menu, and then and select View profiling for golden records. The Profiling pane opens, where you can view the details about the vocabulary key values in a graphic format. | . The main profiling details for golden records include the following: . | Total values – the total number of values that the vocabulary key has in the system. | Values over time – a time-series visualization displaying the count of values that appeared in CluedIn over time. The x axis represents the time, and the y axis represents the count of values. For a more granular view, you can select a specific time period using the mouse. | Distribution of values (bar gauge) – the distribution of vocabulary key values based on the number of records where each value is used. Each bar represents a distinct value, with the color gradient indicating the frequency of that value’s occurrence in the records: green indicates a lower number of records, while red indicates a higher number of records. This gradient provides a quick visual cue for identifying the most and least common values. | Distribution of values (pie chart) – the distribution of vocabulary key values based on the number of records where each value is used. Each slice of the pie represents a distinct key value, with the area of the slice indicating the frequency of that value’s occurrence in the records. The larger the slice, the higher the number of records that contain the value. This type of visualization helps to quickly understand the relative proportions of different vocabulary key values. | . You can view profiling for golden records at any stage of the data ingestion process: immediately after uploading the data, after creating the mapping, or after processing the data. Profiling is type-specific, so if you change the data type during mapping and then process the data, the profiling dashboard may look different from when you first uploaded the data. For example, if you change the data type for the Revenue column from text to integer, the profiling dashboard will display metrics such as minimum value, maximum value, and average value instead of a breakdown and distribution of text values. You can also view profiling on the vocabulary key page. Duplicates . Once you have created the mapping for the data set, you can check if a specific column contains duplicate values. To view duplicates . | Find the column for which you want to view duplicates. In the column header, open the three-dot menu, and then and select View duplicates. The Duplicates preview pane opens, where you can view the total number of duplicate values in the column (a), identify which values are duplicates (b), and see how many times each duplicate value occurs (c). | .

    "content": "If you identify data gaps, errors, and overall quality issues in your source records and want to fix them before processing, you can do so in the edit mode of the data set. The edit mode allows you to perform various operations and validations on the source records to address these issues. The edit mode is available in data sets created from files and endpoints. When you switch to the edit mode, the original data set is cloned, so you can revert back to it at any time. However, reverting to the original data set means losing all changes made in the edit mode. To switch to the edit mode . | In the upper-right corner of the data set page, select Switch to edit mode. | Review the instructions about the edit mode, and then confirm that you want to switch to the edit mode. Depending on the size of your data set, switching to the edit mode might take some time. You’ll receive a notification when the data set has been switched to the edit mode. If you switch to edit mode for a data set that has already been processed, keep in mind that editing and re-processing this data set might lead to changes in primary identifiers. For example, if the primary identifiers are auto-generated, re-processing the data set will produce new golden records. | . If you decide to go back to the original data set, exit the edit mode. To do that, in the upper-right corner of the data set page, select Switch to original. Then, confirm that you want to switch to the original data set. If you made any changes in the edit mode, they will not be available in the original data set. When your data set is in the edit mode, you can do the following actions: . | Filter records . | Edit values manually . | Transform values using operations . | Add columns . | Remove source records . | . Filter records . Filters help you quickly find specific source records, identify records with empty values, and view column value aggregation. You can apply the following filters to any column: . | Search – select or enter a specific value to search for all records containing that value. You can choose to display the results that precisely match the entered value (Precise match) or those that exclude it (Inverse). | Is empty – display all records where the column contains empty values. | Is not empty – display all records where the column does not contain empty values. | Aggregation – consolidate and summarize all values contained in the column. | Invalid fields – display all records that contain invalid fields according to column validation result. If no validation is applied to the column, this filtering option is unavailable. Learn more about validation in Source record validation. | Valid fields – display all records that contain valid fields according to column validation result. If no validation is applied to the column, this filtering option is unavailable. Learn more about validation in Source record validation. | . You can use filters when you need to find incorrect or empty values. Once you find them, you can fix them by editing the values manually. To apply a filter . | Find the column you want to filter. In the column header, open the three-dot menu, select Filter, and then select the needed filtering option. As a result, the records matching the filter are displayed on the page. All applied filters are listed on the Filters pane. If you don’t need a filter temporarily, you can disable it and enable it again when needed. If you no longer need a filter, you can delete it by selecting the delete icon. | . Edit values manually . If you notice that your source records contain invalid values, missing values, or other issues and want to fix them before processing, you can do it by modifying the values manually. This way, you can fix incorrect spelling, provide missing values, or make any other changes. To edit a value manually . | Find a record containing a value that you want to edit. To quickly find the needed record, use filters. | Click on the cell containing a value that you want to edit and make the needed changes. The edited value is formatted in bold. | Select Save. The bold formatting of the changed value disappears. The history of your manual changes is displayed on the Operations tab. If you no longer need the change or you made it by mistake, you can revert the change. To do it, select the delete icon next to the operation name or the revert icon in the upper-right corner. Note that changes can only be reverted consecutively, one by one, and not selectively. | . Transform values using operations . You can transform and improve the contents of columns automatically and efficiently using operations. For example, you can transform the values to upper case, remove extra spaces, replace one value with another, and more. The following table shows all available operations and their description. | Operation | Description | . | Camel case | Transform all values in the column to camel case (directorOfSales). | . | Capitalize | Change the first letter of the first word to uppercase (Director of sales). | . | Decapitalize | Change the first letter of the first word to lowercase (director of sales). | . | Auto-generated value | Replace values with automatically created unique values. | . | Kebab case | Transform all values in the column to kebab case (director-of-sales). | . | Lower case | Transform all values in the column to lowercase (director of sales). | . | Set value | Replace all values in the column with the specified value. | . | Slugify | Convert a string into a lowercase, hyphen-separated version of the string, with all special characters removed. | . | Swap case | Invert the case of each letter in a string. This means that all uppercase letters are converted to lowercase, and all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase. | . | Trim | Remove all leading and trailing whitespace from a string. | . | Trim Left | Remove only the leading whitespace from a string. | . | Trim Right | Remove only the trailing whitespace from a string. | . | Upper case | Convert all letters of each word to uppercase (DIRECTOR OF SALES). | . | Title case | Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase (Director Of Sales). | . | Keep only numbers | Extract and retain only the numeric characters from a string, removing any non-numeric characters. | . | To Boolean | Convert a value to a Boolean data type, which can be either true or false. | . | Replace | Replace the first occurrence of a specified pattern within a string with another character or sequence of characters. | . | Replace all | Replace all occurrences of a specified pattern within a string with another character or sequence of characters. | . | Replace spaces | Replace spaces in a string with another character or sequence of characters. | . | Replace character(s) with space | Replace specified characters with a space. | . To transform values in a column using an operation . | Find the column containing values that you want to transform. In the column header, open the three-dot menu, select Operations, and then select the needed operation. As a result, the values in the column are automatically transformed. All applied operations are displayed on the Operations pane. If you no longer need the change or you made it by mistake, you can revert the change. To do it, select the delete icon next to the operation name or the revert icon in the upper-right corner. Note that changes can only be reverted consecutively, one by one, and not selectively. | . Add columns . You can add new columns to your dataset. This is useful for combining values from other columns or creating an empty column for new values. There are two types of columns that you can add: . | Stored column – the values are generated only at the column creation time. If new records appear in the data set afterwards, the stored column in such records will contain empty values. Stored column may be a good choice when working with a data set created from a file, which will not change over time. | Computed column – the values are combined from already existing columns into one new column. Computed column may be a good choice when working with a data set created from an endpoint, which will receive new records over time. | . To add a column to the data set . | Select Add column. | Enter the column name and select the column type. | Select Next. | Choose an option for generating the values for the column: . | (Stored column) Empty – a new column with empty fields will be added to the data set. | (Stored column or computed column) From existing fields – select the fields from the data set that you want to combine to create values for a new column. You can add multiple fields. By default, the values are separated with a space, but you can enter another delimiter if needed. | (Stored column or computed column) Expression – enter a C.E.L supported expression to create values for a new column. | . | Select Save. The new column is added to the data set and is marked with the information icon. If you no longer need the column, you can delete it. To delete the computed column, open the three-dot menu in the column header, select Delete computed field, and then confirm your choice. To delete the stored column, open the Operations pane, and then select the delete icon for the corresponding operation or the revert icon in the upper-right corner. Note that operations can only be reverted consecutively, one by one, and not selectively. | . Remove source records . If you do not need specific source records, you can remove them from the data set. To remove source records . | Select the checkbox next to the source record that you want to remove. | Select the delete icon. | In the confirmation dialog, enter DELETE, and then select Confirm. As a result, the records are removed from the data set. This change is displayed on the Operations tab. If you removed the records by mistake, you can revert the change. To do it, select the delete icon for the corresponding operation or the revert icon in the upper-right corner.

For example, the cron expression 0 18 * * * means that the files will be exported every day at 6:00 PM. | . | (Optional) File Name Pattern – a file name pattern for the export file. For more information, see File name patterns. For example, in the {ContainerName}.{OutputFormat} pattern, {ContainerName} is the Target Name in the stream, and {OutputFormat} is the output format that you select in step 3j. In this case, every time the scheduled export occurs, it will generate the same file name, replacing the previously exported file. If you do not specify the file name pattern, CluedIn will use the default file name pattern: {StreamId:N}_{DataTime:yyyyMMddHHmmss}.{OutputFormat}. | . | Test the connection to make sure it works, and then select Add. | .

Use terminology familiar to your line of business (LOB) to help identify records intuitively. CluedIn is flexible—if you choose an initial business domain that needs adjustment, you can change it. However, changing business domains mid-project can be cumbersome, especially if deduplication projects, rules, or streaming configurations have already been applied. Filtering golden records . Business domain acts as the default filter for many operations in CluedIn. Selecting the right business domain allows you to target groups of golden records that logically belong together.

An identifier (previously known as code) is a mechanism that CluedIn uses to define the uniqueness of a golden record. During processing, if two clues share the same identifier, they are merged into a single golden record. This ensures that data from different sources is unified under a consistent, unique identifier. Example . Let’s explore the concept of identifiers in CluedIn through an example. We have a golden record—John Smith—that originates from the HR system. One of the identifiers for this golden record is created using the ID. Now, a new record from the CRM system appears in CluedIn, and one of its identifiers matches the code of the golden record from the HR system. As a result, the new CRM record is merged with the existing HR record, integrating any new properties from the CRM record into the existing golden record. To find all the identifiers that uniquely represent a golden record in the system, go to the golden record page, and select View Identifiers. The identifiers are divided into two sections: . | Primary identifier – this is the primary unique identifier of a golden record in CluedIn. | Identifiers – this section contains all identifiers associated with a golden record. | .

    "title": "Primary identifier",
    "content": "A primary identifier (previously knows as entity origin code) is a primary unique identifier of a record in CluedIn. The required details for producing the primary identifier are established when the mapping for a data set is created. To find these details, go to the Map tab of the data set and select Edit mapping. On the Map entity tab, you’ll find the Primary Identifier section, which contains the required details for producing the primary identifier. The primary identifier is made up from the business domain (1), the origin (2), and the value of the property that was selected for producing the primary identifier (3). This combination allows achieving absolute uniqueness across any data source that you interact with. There might be cases when the property for producing the primary identifier is empty or you don’t have any property suitable for defining uniqueness. In the following sections, we’ll explore different ways for defining uniqueness. Empty value in primary identifier . If the property that you selected in your mapping for producing the primary identifier has an empty value, then this empty value will be converted to a hash code that will try to represent uniqueness. Please note that even if the hash code is a good fallback option, you need to consider if it is viable for your source of data. For data sets that have many empty values or are incomplete, it can lead to unwanted merges. Consider the following example, where the hash code will be e7c4d00573302d3b1432fd14d89e5dd0dc68a0ea. { firstName: \"Robert\", lastName: \"Smith\" } . Hash codes are case sensitive. So, with the same properties as in the example above, but all values in lower case, the hash code will be 479b8ebe1612297996532b9abeeb9feee4ed4569. { firstName: \"robert\", lastName: \"smith\" } . Auto-generated key in primary identifier . If your records do not have a property suitable for defining uniqueness, you can select the auto-generated option for producing the primary identifier in mapping. As a result, CluedIn will generate unique primary identifiers for the records using hash codes as documented above. When not to use auto-generated keys? . If you are using hash codes, remember that when the record is changed, the value of the identifier will change as well. It means that you should avoid using auto-generated keys when you edit a data set. In CluedIn, we offer you the possibility to edit the source data. This is a great option as it can lead to much faster and better results in your golden records. However, if you use the auto-generated key to produce the primary identifier, each time you change the value, it will generate a different identifier. For example, let’s say you have some rules to capitalize firstName and lastName. Let’s assume we have 2 records. [{ firstName: \"Robert\", lastName: \"Smith\" }, { firstName: \"robert\", lastName: \"smith\" }] . If we add a rule to capitalize firstName and lastName, the records will be changed as in the example below. [{ firstName: \"Robert\", lastName: \"Smith\" }, { firstName: \"Robert\", lastName: \"Smith\" }] . If you use the auto-generated key to produce the primary identifier, these two records will use the same hash code e7c4d00573302d3b1432fd14d89e5dd0dc68a0ea, so they will merge. However, if you have already processed the data, it can lead to duplication. Let’s trace this process step-by-step. | Upload the following JSON: . [{ firstName: \"Robert\", lastName: \"Smith\" }, { firstName: \"robert\", lastName: \"smith\" }] . | Map the data with Auto-generated key to produce the primary identifier. | Process the data. | Switch to edit mode for the data set. | Apply changes to the data set, such as capitalize firstName and lastName. | Re-process the data. | . As a result, you will have 2 golden records because you have changed the primary identifier of the golden record that had lowercase values. When you process the records for the first time in step 3, you send 2 different codes: . 1. e7c4d00573302d3b1432fd14d89e5dd0dc68a0ea, the hash code with values capitalized. 2. 479b8ebe1612297996532b9abeeb9feee4ed4569, the hash code with values in lowercase. When you process the records for the second time in step 6, you send the same code 2 times: . 3. e7c4d00573302d3b1432fd14d89e5dd0dc68a0ea, the hash code with values capitalized. 4. e7c4d00573302d3b1432fd14d89e5dd0dc68a0ea, identical hash code for the record that initially was in lowercase but has been capitalized in edit mode. The records with codes 1, 3, and 4 will merge together. And the record with code 2 will remain as a separate golden record. If you want to edit your records in the source, do not use auto-generated key for producing the primary identifier. Compound key (MDM code) in primary identifier . If you do not want to use an auto-generated key to produce the primary identifier, you can use a compound key. A compound key is built by concatenating different attributes to ensure uniqueness. It is commonly referred to as the MMDM code. For example, an MDM code can combine multiple attributes for a customer. - firstName - lastName - line 1 - city - country - date of birth . If you go with the MDM code, make sure you normalize the values by either creating a computed column for your data set or by adding a bit of glue code in using advanced mapping. Our CluedIn experts can assist you with this task. Normalizing the MDM code is important because it will prevent scenarios where editing values changes the primary identifier, leading to undesired effects. Lack of options to define uniqueness . What to do if there is no way to define uniqueness? . If you have no way to define uniqueness for your records, generate a GUID using advanced mapping or a pre-process rule. However, each time you process the records, duplicates will be created. So, use this option for one-time only ingestion. What to if there is no way to define uniqueness and you need to re-process data multiple times? . If this is your case, the only way is to fix the issue on the source level. You can modify the source of data to set up some kind of uniqueness. For example, if you have a SQL table, you can add a unique identifier for each row. ",

On the Map entity tab, you’ll find the Identifiers section, which contains the required details for producing the identifiers. If a data set contains additional columns that can serve as unique identifiers besides the ones used for producing the primary identifier, then these columns can also be used to produce additional identifiers. For example, if the primary identifier is produced using the ID, then the additional identifier could be produced using the email. The identifiers are made up from the business domain, origin, and the value from the column that was selected for producing the identifiers. In the Identifiers section, you can instruct CluedIn to produce additional codes: . | Provider name identifiers – identifiers that are built form the business domain, provider name (for example, File Data Source), and the value from the column that was selected for producing the primary identifier. | Strict edge identifiers – identifiers that are built from the business domain, data source group ID/data source ID/data set ID, and the value from the column that was selected for producing the primary identifier. | .

    "content": "How to make sure that the identifiers will blend across different data sources? . Since an identifier will only merge with another identifier if they are identical, how can you merge records across different systems if the origin is different? One of the ways to achieve it is through the GUID. If a record has an identifier that is a GUID/UUID, you can set the origin as CluedIn because no matter the system, the identifier should be unique. However, this is not applicable if you are using deterministic GUIDS. If you’re wondering whether you use deterministic GUIDs, conducting preliminary analysis on the data can help. Check if many GUIDs overlap in a certain sequence, such as the first chunk of the GUID being replicated many times. This is a strong indicator that you are using deterministic GUIDs. Random GUIDs are so unique that the chance of them being the same is close to impossible. You could even determine that the business domain can be generic as well. You will have to craft these special identifiers in your clues (for example, something like /Generic#CluedIn:&lt;GUID&gt;). You will need to make sure your edges support the same mechanism. In doing this, you are instructing CluedIn that no matter the business domain, no matter the origin of the data, this record can be uniquely identified by just the GUID. What if a record doesn’t have a unique reference to construct an identifier? . Often you will find that you need to merge or link records across systems that don’t have IDs but rather require fuzzy merging to be able to link records. In this case, we often suggest creating a composite identifier constructed from a combination of column or property values that guarantee uniqueness. For example, if you have a Transaction record, you might find that a combination of the Transaction Date, Product, Location, and Store will guarantee uniqueness. It is best to calculate a “Hash” of these values combined, which means that we can calculate an identifier from this. What if a key is not ready for producing an identifier? . Sometimes keys for identifiers are not ready to be made into a unique primary identifier. For example, your data might include default or fallback values when a real value is not present. Imagine you have an EmployeeId column, and when a value is missing, placeholders like “NONE”, “”, or “N/A” are used. These are not valid identifiers for the EmployeeId. However, the important aspect is that you cannot handle all permutations of these placeholders upfront. Therefore, you should create identifiers with the intention that these values are unique. You can fix and clean up such values later. ",

    "content": "In this article, you will learn how to remove records (also referred to as data parts) that were created from a specific data source. For more information about records, data parts, and golden records, see Data life cycle. If you no longer need records from a specific data source, you can easily remove them. If a record is not merged during processing, it becomes a golden record. Removing such a record also removes the golden record. However, if a record is merged into the existing golden record, removing it doesn’t remove the entire golden record; only the specific data part represented by that record is removed. Keep in mind that when you remove records from CluedIn, the count of billable records will decrease when it is recalculated. After removing records, you’ll notice that the Data tab disappears from the data set. Additionally, the Process tab won’t contain any information about previous processing. However, the incoming records on the Preview tab remain intact; and the mapping configuration on the Map tab is preserved, so you can edit, reset, or reuse it for other data sets. Removing records can be useful in the following cases: . | If you notice an error in the mapping configuration. Although the mapping configuration is preserved after removing records, you can reset the mapping and start again. | If you processed a subset of data to test the mapping configuration and you don’t need the test data anymore. Since the mapping configuration is preserved, you can reuse it for other data sets. | . What happens if you remove records from one of the data sources that form a golden record? . Consider a scenario where a golden record is composed of data parts from three sources. If you remove records from one of these sources, the corresponding data part will be removed from the golden record. This means that all properties originating from the data part are removed from the golden record, and the data part itself is deleted from the history of the golden record. Since the records from the other sources remain intact, the golden record still exists. However, if you remove records from all sources that form a golden record, then the golden record will be deleted. What is the difference between removing records and deleting golden records using the GraphQL tool? . Removing records from a specific data source is designed to remove the corresponding data parts from all relevant golden records. If these golden records contain other data parts, they will continue to exist. On the other hand, deleting a golden record using the GraphQL tool will result in the complete deletion of the entire golden record. To remove records . | On the navigation pane, go to Integrations &gt; Data Sources. | Find and open the data source that contains records that you want to remove. | Near the upper-right corner of the data source details page, select Remove records. The Remove processed records dialog opens where you can view the number of records that will be removed as well as the data set containing those records. | Confirm that you want to remove records by entering REMOVE. Then, select Remove records. | . The process of removing records might take some time. During or after the process of removing records, you can make changes in the data set (edit mapping, add or remove property or pre-process rules) or process the data set again. If you are working with an ingestion endpoint data source, you can also remove records that were produced from a specific request send to that ingestion endpoint. For more details, see Ingestion reports. ",

    "content": "The primary purpose of vocabulary is to hold vocabulary keys. Vocabulary keys are your way to be able to describe properties that are coming in from data sources. A vocabulary is composed of multiple vocabulary groups and multiple vocabulary keys. Vocabulary prefix . The vocabulary prefix is a part of what we call the full vocabulary key. It is added before vocabulary key names for consistent naming, efficient searching, and data filtering. The prefix is stored in our databases and is given automatically when adding a vocabulary key to a given vocabulary. Changing the prefix of an existing vocabulary could influence many records and would require their re-processing. For example, let’s take the prefix contact_person and two vocabulary keys firstName and lastName. If you want to rename contact_person to contactPerson, it means that all golden records using contact_person.firstName and contact_person.lastName will need to be changed. Applying those changes on millions of golden records might require a bit of time. Vocabulary keys (attributes) . To maintain proper data lineage, it is recommended that the key name is set to the exact same value of the property name coming in from the source system. Vocabulary groups . A vocabulary group is an optional group for organizing vocabulary keys in a logical collection. It is used for aesthetic purposes and has no influence on your records. For example, you could have the Social group for the vocabulary Contact. This group would have the following vocabulary keys: . | LinkedIn Profile | X.com username | Website | Blog | . If you do not provide any group for your vocabulary keys, they will be located in a group called Ungrouped Keys. ",

    "title": "Vocabulary usage",
    "content": "One vocabulary per source . Even if it is tempting to reuse the vocabulary across multiple sources, you should keep the vocabulary close to your sources for the lineage purposes. This gives you better flexibility when working with clean projects, rules, or deduplication projects because you’ll know where a specific vocabulary key is coming from. To start using what we call shared vocabulary, you need to map one vocabulary key to another. For example, let’s take a field called Email from the CRM source. You would use a vocabulary key called CRM.contact.email. The CRM.contact would be the prefix of a vocabulary (which is probably called CRM Contact), and email would be a child vocabulary key of CRM Contact. So, the full vocabulary key is CRM.contact.email. Now, you add a field called Email from the ERP source. In this case, you would use a vocabulary key called ERP.contact.email. The ERP.contact would be the prefix of a vocabulary (which is probably called ERP Contact), and email would be a child vocabulary key of ERP Contact. So, the full vocabulary key is ERP.contact.email. Obviously, those 2 keys—CRM.contact.email and ERP.contact.email—represent the same meaning, so you would want to have a single shared vocabulary key called contact.email to be used in your golden records. This is possible to achieve by mapping those 2 keys to the shared vocabulary key called contact.email. This means that the data will be flowing towards the shared vocabulary key, and the values of CRM.contact.email and ERP.contact.email will now all be located in contact.email (as shown in the table below). | Source | Vocabulary | Vocabulary key | Maps to | . | CRM | CRM.contact | email | contact.email | . | ERP | ERP.contact | email | contact.email | . By applying this principle, you can keep your lineage and have better flexibility and agility. However, it is up to you to decide when and if you want to map vocabulary keys with the same meaning to a shared vocabulary key or keep them separate. Business domain vs. vocabulary . When you map your data in CluedIn, you can map it to one business domain and one vocabulary. However, a vocabulary can be shared among different business domains and can represent only a partial aspect of the golden record. So, the following statements are true when describing a golden record: . | You can assign only one business domain to a golden record. | You can use multiple vocabularies for a golden record. | . By distinguishing between business domain and vocabulary, we decouple the value aspect of records from their modeling aspect. This approach provides greater flexibility in modeling and allows for evolution with changing use cases. ",

    "title": "Core vocabularies",
    "content": "Core vocabularies are where a lot of the “smarts” in CluedIn exist. If you map your custom integration sources’ keys into core vocabulary keys, there is a high likelihood that something will be done on the data to your advantage. For example, if you map a phone number into a core vocabulary Phone Number Key, then CluedIn will, amongst other things: . | Create new normalized representations of the phone number in industry standards e.g. E164. | Will see if we can confidentially identify or merge records based off this phone number. | . The role of core vocabularies is to merge records from different systems based on knowing that these clues will have a different origin. As you have already learnt about entity codes, they need to be exact for a merge to occur and simply the change of the origin could cause records not to merge. Although you can add your own core vocabularies, we suggest that you do not. The reason is mainly due to upgrade support and making sure your upgrades are as seamless and automated as possible. Core vocabularies do not include the namespace for a source system. It will typically have the business domain, the name of the key - or if it is a nested key like and address, it will have the nesting shown in the key name: . | organization.industry | organization.address.city | organization.address.countryName | person.age | person.gender | . Vocabularies are allowed (and designed) to be hierarchical in nature. This means that you can have many (max 10) levels of hierarchy in your vocabularies. This is to allow you to be able to map source systems into a Company, Department, Team, or other levels. Here is a simple example of how a vocabulary key could map from source to core. hubspot.contact.contactName - Provider Level lego.sales.contact.fullName - Department Level lego.marketing.contact.leadName - Department Level lego.contact.Name - Company Level person.fullName - CluedIn Core Vocabulary .

Pick the version to upgrade from the output list . | . With the above steps completed, it’s time to upgrade. Depending on if you pass or fail the prerequisites, please follow the appropriate path below: . | Passed | Failed | . Upgrade with Azure checks passed . Because everything checks out from the Azure side, you should be able to upgrade the Kubernetes cluster without any issues. Please note that Kubernetes follows an upgrade path and it’s not always possible to upgrade from a lower version to a much higher version. You may need to perform this operation a number of times. To upgrade the cluster . | Determine what version of Kubernetes you will need to get to, and then perform the below steps until you are successfully running that version. | Open up pwsh | Run the following commands: . $params = @( '--name', ${aksClusterName} '--resource-group', ${resourceGroup} '--subscription', ${subscription} '--kubernetes-version', '1.nn.n' # This will vary depending on what CluedIn version you are running. '--yes' ) az aks upgrade @params . | It will take between 5-15 minutes to complete each upgrade. Once you have completed the upgrade path to the necessary version, scale up your environment again following the steps here. | . If you are unsure about any of the steps above, please reach out to CluedIn support. Upgrade with Azure checks NOT passed . When you do not have the correct setup to perform a smooth upgrade, additional steps are going to be required to get your environment upgraded to the desired supported version. If at any point in this section you are not comfortable with the steps, please reach out to CluedIn support. Make notes of the current node pools as these will be deleted as part of the process. This includes taints, labels, and any other potential configurations. | Open up pwsh | Run the following commands: . $aksClusterParams = @( '--name', ${aksClusterName} '--resource-group', ${resourceGroup} '--subscription', ${subscription} ) $aksCluster = az aks show @aksClusterParams | ConvertFrom-Json $aksNodePools = $aksCluster.agentPoolProfiles . | The above will return back an object that contains the agent pool configuration. This can be queried by running $aksNodePools in your shell and making notes of the configuration. It is unlikely you need to touch the System node pool, so chances are you only need to make notes of the User node pools which is what CluedIn runs on. Make notes of the following configuration for each node you need to delete: . | name | nodeCount | nodeVmSize | maxPods | vnetSubnetId | labels | taints | . Note: As long as the PowerShell session doesn’t get closed, this object will always exist to reference. | In PowerShell, run the following commands: . $params = @( '--nodepool-name', ${nodeName} # This is the name of the node pool you are attempting to delete '--cluster-name', ${aksClusterName} '--resource-group', ${resourceGroup} '--subscription', ${subscription} ) az aks nodepool delete @params . Note: You need to repeat this for all node pools that are affected by either the IP address allocation or quota (based on the VM SKU it is using). | Because all affected node pools have now been deleted, you should perform the upgrade steps next until your desired version. Follow the steps above here and return back here once you have hit your version. | With Kubernetes control plane now updated, it’s time to recreate the node pools before scaling the application back up. | In pwsh run the following commands: . $params = @( '--cluster-name', ${aksClusterName} '--resource-group', ${resourceGroup} '--subscription', ${subscription} '--name', ${nodeName} '--mode', 'User' '--node-count', ${nodeCount} '--node-vm-size', ${nodeVmSku} '--max-pods', ${nodeMaxPods} '--vnet-subnet-id', ${nodeVnetSubnetId} # Optionals # '--node-taints', ${nodeTaints} key=value format # '--labels', ${nodeLabels} # key=value format # '--enable-cluster-autoscaler' ) az aks nodepool add @params . Note: You need to repeat this for all node pools that were affected by either the IP address allocation or quota (based on the VM SKU it is using). | All nodepools should now be added back. You can validate in the Azure portal by navigating to the AKS cluster resource and selecting Node Pools on the left hand blade.

However, you can change the origin during mapping if needed. As mentioned in our Identifiers reference article, the origin is used in the primary identifier and the identifiers.

    "content": "Since the origin is used in the primary identifier and the identifiers, it plays a role in merging—when 2 identifiers are identical, the records will merge together. To understand the role of origin in merging, suppose you have an attribute that you can safely rely on to merge records across source systems. Let’s say this attribute is a SerialNumber that is used in your CRM, ERP, and Support systems. As the serial number is unique and cross-system, you can use it to merge together all golden records that have the same serial number. Of course, you can achieve this using our UI; however, there is a faster way to do this via merging by identifiers. Let’s consider the example of three records, each coming from a different source system—CRM, ERP, and Support. For each data source, we select the Serial Number to produce the primary identifier. The following table shows the identifiers that will be produced by default. | Source | Business domain | Origin | Primary identifier | . | CRM | Product | crm | /Product#crm:[SERIAL NUMBER VALUE] | . | ERP | Product | erp | /Product#erp:[SERIAL NUMBER VALUE] | . | Support System | Product | support | /Product#support:[SERIAL NUMBER VALUE] | . Even if the serial number is the same, the records will not merge together as the origin of each record is different. So, how would you use the serial number to merge records together? The answer is by producing an identifier that shares the same origin, for example, PRODUCT-SERIALNUMBER. As a result, the identifier for each record will share the same business domain, origin, and the value of serial number as shown in the following table. | Source | Business domain | Origin | Primary identifier | . | CRM | Product | PRODUCT-SERIALNUMBER | /Product#PRODUCT-SERIALNUMBER:[SERIAL NUMBER VALUE] | . | ERP | Product | PRODUCT-SERIALNUMBER | /Product#PRODUCT-SERIALNUMBER:[SERIAL NUMBER VALUE] | . | Support System | Product | PRODUCT-SERIALNUMBER | /Product#PRODUCT-SERIALNUMBER:[SERIAL NUMBER VALUE] | . Since the origin is shared among different sources, each time the same serial number for a product is sent to CluedIn, it will be merged. ",

To create a relationship using identifiers, you need to know the origin of target golden records. These are the golden records to which you want to link current records. Suppose you have Contact records that contain the companyID property, and you know that you have Company records with this ID. To establish a link between Contact and Company, you need to define the “to” relationship by setting up the following: . | Business domain: /Company | Origin: [ORIGIN-OF-COMPANY-RECORDS] | Value: Company ID | . The combination of those 3 values needs to match one of the identifiers of target records. To make the process of linking golden records easier, you can use the recommendation for defining the origin that we provided in Merging by identifiers. Essentially, the method of shared origin that you use for merging by identifiers can also be used to facilitate the process of linking golden records. This way you do not have to rely on the source system and instead use the origin that you defined for related data. ",

Connect to Kubernetes master server . To connect your agent to the Kubernetes cluster running the CluedIn Server, API, and JobServer, fill in the following configuration values in container.config: . | ServerUrl – The route to your CluedIn Web API. For example, https://app.&lt;hostname&gt;/api/. | AgentServerUrl – The route to your CluedIn Web API. For example, https://app.&lt;hostname&gt;/api/. | ServerBlobUrl – The route to your Blob storage. By default, this is the same as your Web API URL. | WebhookUrl – The route to your Webhook API. By default, it should be https://app.&lt;hostname&gt;/webhooks/. | ServerStatusUrl – The status endpoint of your Web API. By default, it should be https://app.&lt;hostname&gt;/api/status. | ServerLoggingUrl – The logging endpoint of your Web API. By default, it should be https://app.&lt;hostname&gt;/api/. | AuthServerUrl – The route to your Authentication API. By default, it should be ttps://app.&lt;hostname&gt;/auth/. | . Agent authentication . By default, the agent is already configured to run on a standard on-premises crawler. Changing the token is recommended but not required for the agent to communicate with the server. The agent you downloaded must authenticate against a registered agent within the CluedIn server. You can register the agent in two ways: . | Port-forward to the CluedIn SQL Server pod in your Kubernetes cluster: . kubectl port-forward -l app=sqlserver 1433 --address 0.0.0.0 . Then, add an agent registration under DataStore.Db.OpenCommunication &gt; dbo.Agent. | Run a SQL query directly against the DataStore.Db.OpenCommunication database, as in the following example: . DECLARE @AgentId varchar(60); SET @AgentId = '6CF17140-0FB0-47C5-AAAA-9A40A0ECF8BA'; DECLARE @AgentGroup varchar(60); SET @AgentGroup = '612ed11a-b1b3-463f-b4a5-7c1bb7bd55a0'; DECLARE @AgentToken varchar(60); SET @AgentToken = '--- INSERT YOUR API TOKEN HERE ---'; DECLARE @OrganizationId varchar(60); SET @OrganizationId = (SELECT Id AS OrganizationId FROM dbo.OrganizationProfile WHERE OrganizationName = '--- INSERT YOUR CLIENT ID HERE ---'); DECLARE @DateTimeMin varchar(60); SET @DateTimeMin = (select cast(-53690 as datetime)); UPDATE dbo.Agent SET AccountId = @OrganizationId, ApiKey = @AgentToken, LastPing = @DateTimeMin WHERE Id = @AgentId; . After completing the registration, copy the API token you created and set it as the value of ApiKey in the container.config file you downloaded earlier. | . Deploy crawlers . To deploy a crawler into an agent, you will need the crawler assembly files (DLLs), either: . | From a NuGet package. | Or, by compiling and building the crawler locally on your developer machine. | . Required assemblies: . | CluedIn.Crawling._CrawlerName_ . | CluedIn.Crawling._CrawlerName_.Core . | CluedIn.Crawling._CrawlerName_.Infrastructure1 . | . The provider project is not required in the agent, because the provider is registered in the cloud Web API instance. Everything in the provider project is executed from the cluster. Ensure that all dependencies needed by your crawler (such as NuGet dependencies) are deployed along with the crawler assemblies. To deploy a crawler . | Move the crawler assemblies into &lt;agent-root&gt;/Agent. The assemblies will be picked up automatically when the agent starts. | On the cluster, deploy the following: . | All crawler packages listed above. | The provider project’s NuGet package parts responsible for your crawler (these will be executed by the agent). | . | . Run the agent . | To run the agent, simply start the boot.sh file. On Windows, you may need to install a tool like Cygwin to run .sh files. When the agent starts, you will see an output showing: . | Assemblies being loaded. | The agent attempting to connect to the cluster. | . | Review the output and ensure there are no networking issues blocking the calls to the API server. Once connected, you can do the following: . | Sign in to CluedIn, add your integration, and the data crawling will be executed by the agent instead of the CluedIn server in the Kubernetes cluster. | Register the agent as a Windows Service so that it automatically restarts if the Windows VM reboots. For details, see the corresponding Microsoft guide. | . | . Enable verbose logging . By default, the agent runs with low logging verbosity. To increase verbosity . | Set the environment variable: $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"verbose\". | To make this setting persistent on the machine, configure it as a system variable. | Restart both: . | The agent. | The bash/command prompt session used to run boot.sh. | . | . The changes will take effect after the restart. ",

You get flexibility and standardization—just at the right stage. Q: When would I choose a Strict Edge? A: Small, controlled domains with guaranteed referential integrity where a missing target must fail fast (e.g., reference tax codes). Q: How do I control “who wins” when fields disagree? A: Use survivorship rules: source trust ranking, last-updated recency, field completeness, or quality scores; never blanket “system X always wins”. Summary . To integrate hundreds of sources with CluedIn, optimize for speed-to-land and correctness-over-time. Let models emerge from real data, connect nodes with Edges that resolve as identities converge, and postpone strictness until you have evidence. Your graph will become richer, more accurate, and easier to maintain—without the drag of upfront over-modeling. ",

    "content": "When you need to upload a large set of records to CluedIn, we recommend that you start by uploading a small, representative subset of your data in CSV or JSON format. This approach allows you to verify the accuracy of mapping and relations before dealing with a large set of records. Once the golden records generated from this subset align with your expectations, you can safely remove those records from the system, while keeping the mapping configuration intact. After that you can upload a large set of records and use the existing mapping to generate golden records in an efficient way. CluedIn file uploader accommodates structured data, so you can upload the files in CSV, JSON, or basic Excel formats. After you upload a JSON or XLS/XLSX file, we recommend that you download an example file provided by the system. This example serves as a reference to confirm the expected data format. If your file deviates from this format, adjust it according to the example to ensure a smooth data ingestion process. The data ingestion process for files consists of three stages: uploading, parsing, and loading. When your file adheres to the required data format and each stage executes without interruption, the entire process runs seamlessly. However, to efficiently address issues that might arise during the data ingestion process, get acquainted with the potential reasons for failure at each stage: . | If the upload fails, the recovery of the file is not possible. Such a situation may arise if the file upload was initiated but the browser tab was closed while the upload was in progress. To resolve this, remove the data source and upload the file again. | If the parsing fails—for example, due to the file being corrupted or having invalid data format—you will see a corresponding error message from the parser. To resolve this, remove the data source, fix the file and make sure it conforms to the required data format, and upload the file again. | If the loading fails, you will see an error message with the number of chunks that could not be loaded.

    "title": "Introduction",
    "content": "Queues are central to how CluedIn operates. Each operation or record in CluedIn is represented as a message in a queue. This design means that to truly understand how CluedIn functions under the hood, you need to understand how these queues behave. Some of these queues are visible directly in the CluedIn UI—for example, on the Monitoring tab of a data set or within the Processing Pipeline section in Engine Room. For customers running CluedIn in a self-managed environment, a great deal of insight can be gained simply by observing the state of these queues. You might ask questions like: . | How many messages are currently in a queue? . | How many consumers are connected to a given queue? . | Are there any dead-letter messages? . | . Why CluedIn uses a service bus instead of an event log? . A common question is: why did CluedIn adopt a queue-based service bus architecture (e.g., RabbitMQ) instead of a log-based event-driven system (e.g., Kafka)? The answer lies in a combination of operational simplicity, data safety, and reliability. While both approaches are valid and widely used in modern architectures, event-driven platforms like Kafka come with added complexity—especially in areas like infrastructure (e.g., managing Zookeeper), monitoring, and tracing data lineage. They also follow a different philosophy: Kafka acts more like a distributed commit log where messages are retained for a period and can be replayed, while RabbitMQ uses a work queue model where messages are consumed and removed. CluedIn made an early architectural decision to use a service bus and an actor model. This approach provided a few key advantages: . | Easier traceability – it’s more straightforward to track “who did what and when” in a service bus pattern. | Durability – messages in CluedIn are stored on disk, so even if a service crashes or is restarted (even abruptly), the messages remain intact, virtually eliminating the risk of data loss. | Snapshotting and recovery – the queue-based model makes it easier to pause, inspect, or recover processing flows. | Operational resilience – RabbitMQ offers robust support for acknowledgment, retries, and dead-lettering, which are vital for maintaining a healthy pipeline under load. | . After years of investment in this architecture, we’ve reached a point where CluedIn’s pipeline is stable, performant, and resilient, even under heavy record volumes. This is why we don’t anticipate major architectural changes to this part of the system in the near future. ",

    "content": "When you need to push a large set of records into CluedIn, we recommend that you start by pushing a small, representative subset of your data. As with files, this approach allows you to verify the accuracy of mapping and relations before pushing a large set of records. Once the golden records generated from this subset align with your expectations, you can safely remove those records from the system, while keeping the mapping configuration intact. After that you can push a large set of records and use the existing mapping to generate golden records in an efficient way. After you send an HTTP POST request, CluedIn checks if it is correct based on the built-in logic and limitations. If your JSON is completely invalid, CluedIn won’t start ingesting the data, and you’ll receive a response with the status “400 Bad Request”. The response body will include an array of errors that provide context for fixing them. Once you correct the request, you can try sending it again. If your JSON contains issues, such as spaces or dots in property names, CluedIn tries to fix them and store the data. These issues are treated as warnings and they are recorded on the Logs tab of the data set. You’ll receive a response with the status “200 OK”, which means that the data has been successfully sent to CluedIn. However, the response body will include an array of warnings explaining how the issues were fixed. Once CluedIn receives the data, it initially stores it in a temporary storage, accessible through the Preview tab. To turn the received data into golden records, you need to map it to the semantic model and then process it. (For advanced users) To ensure the creation of the expected golden records, you can generate a sample clue and verify its accuracy before processing.

The Schema Protection feature as follows: . | When the feature us enabled, CluedIn uses the mapping that is currently defined for the dataset as the standard, expected schema. | Every time new data arrives through the endpoint, CluedIn checks whether it matches the expected mapping: . | As usual, the incoming data appears in temporary storage on the Preview tab. | If the data contains new fields (outside of the current mapping), these fields appear on the Map tab.

Ignoring fields is useful to prevent records with new, unmapped fields from being quarantined. | . | When you process the data, the following takes place: . | Records that contain new, unmapped fields (that were not ignored) are moved to quarantine. | Ignored fields are skipped and do not appear in the resulting golden records. | Other fields are processed normally. | . | .

    "content": "In this section, you will learn about our release process and the versioning of product releases. You’ll gain an understanding of the stages that CluedIn features go through before becoming generally available, as well as get to know the versioning scheme that we use to deliver changes. Release stages . In order to prepare new and requested features, enhancements, and fixes, we follow a 6-stage release process. What is more, we are often in multiple release stages simultaneously across several releases. This approach allows us to efficiently prioritize tasks and ensure that features are released in a timely manner. By overlapping stages, we can quickly adapt to changing requirements and deliver continuous improvements. The following table describes each stage of the release process. | Release stage | Description | . | Pre-Planning | This stage is dedicated to the ongoing grooming exercise to keep our backlog up to date.On conclusion of the Planning stage for a given release, we enter the Pre-Planning stage for the subsequent release. The Pre-Planning stage begins with identification of the new top 20 features and improvements and refinement efforts towards them. | . | Planning | During this stage, we assess our groomed backlog items and upcoming customer deadlines. As a result, we create a release manifest detailing expectations and timelines for a given release. | . | Development | This stage is dedicated to active development. This is where the engineering team brings the customer’s ideas to life. It is important for us to stay in communication during this phase to ensure that we are building functionality that brings value to the customer. | . | Beta | This is the first testable version of the release. This is the step where we start regression testing. While this version is available in ACR for customer use, it is not recommended to give access to it without specific relationship management. We recommend using the Beta to demo the functionality and gather feedback.Beta cannot be used in production or with real data. | . | Release Candidate | This is a stable version of the release, with potential for a few outstanding minor issues. We open the Release Candidate for testing by our internal teams and selected customers. If a customer needs specific functionality early, this is the recommended point at which they are upgraded.Even though Release Candidate is a production-ready version of the release, the release assets are not yet ready. | . | Public Availability | This is when our release becomes generally available to customers. The release can be classified as major or minor; this classification affects whether a customer should upgrade. SaaS customers are always on the latest Public Availability release. | . Product release versioning . To support prompt delivery of patches, security fixes, and features, we use a versioning scheme that allows us to deliver changes as they are available rather than waiting for a full platform release. Starting from June 30, 2022, we started using a date-based pattern for versioning. By using dates, we can better communicate to our customers how up to date their instance of CluedIn is. Our date-based version is divided into three parts: Year, Month, and Update. | The Year is always represented as a four-digit year (e.g. 2024). | The Month is always represented as a two-digit month (e.g. 10 for October). | The Update is always represented as at least a two-digit number (e.g. 01 or 10). | . The parts of the version are then separated by . to supply the final version: . | 2024.10.00 – this would be the first release in October 2024. | 2024.10.01 – this would be the first update to the October 2024 release. | 2024.10.14 – this would be the fourteenth update to the October 2024 release. | . Prior to date-based versioning, the CluedIn platform used a semantic versioning scheme. This is an industry standard approach to versioning that we will keep for each of the services and tools that the platform is built on (e.g., Home, Helm, Crawlers, and so on). Each tool or service is its own product and will release changes and updates as they become available. ",

    "content": ". | Properties | Identifiers | Relationships | . After the mapping is created, review the mapping details to make sure that your records will be produced and merged in the most efficient way. This article will guide you through the essential aspects to check when reviewing your mapping details. Before the data is processed, your mapping changes won’t affect the existing records in CluedIn. To open the mapping details, on the Map tab of the data set, select Edit mapping. You’ll see three tabs containing all mapping details: . | Map columns to vocabulary key – here you can check which properties will be sent to CluedIn after processing. | Map entity – here you can check the general details of the records that will be created after processing and the identifiers that will uniquely represent the records. | Add edge relations – here you can create rules for establishing the relationships between golden records. | . Properties . On the Map columns to vocabulary key tab, check how the original fields will be mapped to the vocabulary keys in CluedIn after processing. The following actions are available for you: . | Ignore certain fields if you don’t want to have them in CluedIn after the data is processed. | Map the original field to a different vocabulary key. | Add property rules to improve the quality of mapped records by normalizing and transforming property values. | . Identifiers . On the Map entity tab, review the general mapping details and check the identifiers that will uniquely represent the records in CluedIn—primary identifier and identifiers. What are general details? . | Business domain and vocabulary. | Entity name – name of the records that is displayed on the search results page and on the record details page. | Preview image, description, date created, and date modified – record properties that you can find on the search results page and on the record details page. You can select which column should be used for each of these settings. | . What is a primary identifier? . A primary identifier is a unique identifier of the record in CluedIn. If the primary identifiers are identical, the records will be merged. This merging is faster than creating a deduplication project because it is done on the fly and is based on strict equality matching. The deduplication project, on the other hand, is based on fuzzy matching and requires you to define matching criteria, making it a more time-consuming process. Even if you prefer to merge records by running a deduplication project, merging by primary identifiers produces cleaner, “pre-merged” records. As a result, the deduplication project will generate better results and be more performant. Options for generating the primary identifier . Depending on how unique you consider the records to be, you can choose one of the following options for generating the primary identifier: . | Single key – CluedIn will generate unique primary identifiers for the records based on the selected property. This is the most commonly used option because data often already contains unique identifiers (for example, GUIDs) from the source systems. | Auto-generated key – CluedIn will generate unique primary identifiers for the records. Choosing this option may lead to an increased number of duplicates in the system, but you can mitigate this by running a deduplication project afterwards. | Compound key – CluedIn will generate unique primary identifiers for the records by combining selected properties. Choose this option if you are confident that the data structure won’t change in the future. For example, you can select the following properties to generate a compound key: First Name, Last Name, City, Address Line 1, and Country. | . The following diagram will help you in determining which option to use for generating the primary identifier. Example . We ingested a file with 1,000 records personal data containing the following columns: ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, SSN, and Country Code. To create the mapping, we selected the Auto Mapping type, and CluedIn automatically generated the mapping for the data set. Since our data set included the ‘ID’ column, it was automatically selected as the primary identifier. This is a favorable option because no empty or duplicate values were found during the current data set check. It means that the ID is a reliable value to uniquely represent the record in CluedIn. If we select a column that contains duplicate values (for example, country), the status check will immediately inform us of the number of duplicate values in the data set. By selecting View more details, you can view the number of duplicate values in the data set, which values are duplicates, and the number of times the duplicate value occurs in the data set. Referring to the screenshot below, there are 3 duplicate values in the data set: United States, Canada, and Spain. The value United States occurs in 550 records. If we proceed with this as the primary identifier and process the data, all 550 records will be merged into a single golden record. In this case, the country cannot serve as a unique representation for each record, as it is acceptable for records to share the same country. However, if you are confident that the selected property can uniquely represent the record, you can proceed with processing the data. Records with identical primary identifiers will be automatically merged, eliminating the need for a separate deduplication project. If the primary identifier contains an empty value, it is replaced with a hash. If your data set contains a record that is nearly identical to the one with the hash value, they will not be merged because the hash is a unique value. In such cases, you can initiate a deduplication project as a solution. What are identifiers? . Identifiers can uniquely represent the record in CluedIn, in addition to the primary identifier. If two identifiers are identical, the records will be merged. CluedIn automatically detects properties that can be used as additional identifiers. For example, if the primary identifier is the ID, then the additional identifier could be the email. Even if there are no duplicate values according to the primary identifier, but there are some according to additional identifiers, the records will be merged. The following diagram will help you in determining if you need to add additional identifiers. Relationships . A relationship is a connection or association between two or more golden records that indicates how the records are related or interact with each other. If you want to connect the records from the current data set to other records in CluedIn, you can add relationships between such records. The procedure for adding relationships between records is described in our “Getting started” guide. For more information, see Add relationships between records. You can add a relationship before or after you process the records. If you add a relationship after processing, you need to process the records again. When you start creating a relationship, you have to select a property from the current data set that references another property existing in CluedIn. For instance, in the case of SQL tables, this property could be a foreign key that connects two tables. The relationship will be established based on the selected property. Then, you need to choose the edge mode: . | Edge – CluedIn creates relationships between the records based on the origin. | Strict Edge – CluedIn creates relationships between the records that belong to a specific data set, data source, or data source group. | Fuzzy Edge – CluedIn creates relationships through fuzzy matching based on the Name property of the records. | . After you select the edge mode, you need to choose the edge type to define the nature of relationships between records (for example, /WorksFor, /RequestedBy,/LocatedIn). Example . We have 2 data sets: . | Companies – contains the following columns: Company_ID and Company_Name. | Employees – contains the following columns: EmployeeID, First_Name, Last_Name, and Company_ID. Here, the Company_ID defines the company where an employee works. | . To connect employees to companies in CluedIn, we can create a relationship in the mapping details of the Employees data set. In this case, the Company_ID will serve as the property upon which the relationship is built. We select the Strict Edge mode because we are aware of the data set to which we want to connect the employees. Once the processing is complete, all employees who work for a particular company will be shown on the Relations tab of a company record. ",

Process response script . let parsedContent = JSON.parse(response.Content); let content = parsedContent[0]; let officialName = { 'country.officialName': content.name.official, }; response.Content = JSON.stringify([{ Data: officialName, Score: 0 }]); log(JSON.stringify(response)); . Melissa . Melissa is a widely used address validation and data quality service that helps organizations keep address data accurate, standardized, and up to date. CluedIn can connect to Melissa through its REST API, sending address data for validation. The API responds with standardized and enriched results, which CluedIn processes and maps to the appropriate vocabulary keys for storage and further use. In the following example, ingested company data contains missing or incorrect address details. We will use Melissa REST API calls to send address-related data stored in different vocabulary keys and enrich golden records with validated and parsed addresses. Configure Melissa REST API enricher . To add the Melissa REST API enricher, on the Configure tab, provide the following information: . | Accepted Business Domain: In this example, /Address. | Method: GET. | URL: . In this example, the URL references several vocabulary keys that store address-related data. https://address.melissadata.net/V3/WEB/GlobalAddress/doGlobalAddress?id={APIKey}&amp;a1={Vocabulary:company.address.streetAddress}&amp;loc={Vocabulary:company.address.city}&amp;admarea={Vocabulary:company.address.state}&amp;ctry={Vocabulary:company.address.country}&amp;postal={Vocabulary:company.address.zipcode} . | Headers: . Content-Type=application/json . | Process response script: . This script transforms the raw response into a structured format that fits CluedIn’s schema. let parsedContent = JSON.parse(response.Content); let content=parsedContent.Records[0]; let melissaCountryName=content.CountryName; let melissaCountryISO=content.CountryISO3166_1_Alpha3; let melissaZipcode=content.PostalCode; let melissaFullAddress =content.FormattedAddress; let melissaCity=content.Locality; let melissaState=content.AdministrativeArea; let melissaDeliveryIndicator=content.DeliveryIndicator; let newContent = { 'company.address.city':melissaCity, 'company.address.zipcode':melissaZipcode, 'company.address.state':melissaState, 'company.address.country':melissaCountryISO, 'company.address.vocabKey2':melissaCountryName, 'company.address.vocabKey1':melissaFullAddress, 'company.address.type':melissaDeliveryIndicator, }; //apply conditions if required if ( melissaDeliveryIndicator==='B') { newContent[ 'company.address.type']='Business'; } else if( melissaDeliveryIndicator==='R'){ newContent['company.address.type']='Residential'; } else{ newContent['company.address.type']='Unknown'; } response.Content = JSON.stringify([{ Data: newContent, Score: 0 }]); //log(JSON.stringify(response)); . | . Example of golden record before and after enrichment . An example of a golden record before enrichment: . Same record after enrichment: . | The values for the Type and Zipcode properties were updated. | Two new vocabulary keys (Vocab Key 1 and Vocab Key 2 were added). | . Sample response . Provided below is an example of the response you would receive for the same request in Postman. If you need an additional address line in your golden records, select the relevant fields from the response and add them to the process response script provided earlier on this page.

    "content": "Included in the zipped artifact are a number of .yaml files along with a PowerShell upgrade script. The script is very generic and may not be usable in your environment if your instance of CluedIn is heavily modified. As a result, it should only be used as a reference point rather than something you run. Manual upgrade steps are provided below. Before any upgrade takes place, ensure you have taken a snapshot or backup of all your running PVCs in your AKS cluster. This is very important as databases may be upgraded during this process. Preparation . | Export your current running helm values files. Keep one for this process, and also keep one as a backup. | . Note: You can export by running helm get values cluedin-platform -n cluedin --output yaml &gt; /path/to/file.yaml. This will export the currently connected kubeconfig. | Extract the downloaded artifact to a location where we’ll be working from. | Before the upgrade takes place, you need to apply the data upgrade CRD. You can do this by running kubectl apply -f /path/to/extract/artifact/dataupgrade-crd.yaml -n cluedin. You do not need to modify this file. | Update the platform-custom-values.yaml patch file to include the neo4j password and potentially change the global image tag as it’s shipped with 2024.01.00. This file is part of the extracted artifact. The field is infrastructure.neo4j.neo4j.password. It should be set to xxx in the file, and failing to update this will potentially break the upgrade process. | . Note: You can get the current neo4j password by running kubectl get secret/cluedin-neo4j-secrets -n cluedin -o jsonpath='{.data.neo4j-password}' | base64 --decode . | In the same file, remove any application.cluedin.components.packages which you do not use. This will patch against what is set in your exported values file. | . Now, you are ready to perform the actual upgrade process. It’s done in 3 stages. Upgrade - Stage 1 . Scale down a majority of the running deployments and stateful sets. To do this, run the following: . helm upgrade cluedin-platform -n cluedin cluedin/cluedin-platform \\ --version 2.0.0 \\ --values ${ExportedOriginalValues} \\ --values platform-custom-values.yaml \\ --values platform-upgrade-v2-stage1.yaml \\ --wait \\ --timeout 10m0s . When the above has been ran, you should begin to see a majority of your pods scaling down. It may take 5 minutes, so please be patient. When it has completely scaled down, you’re ready for Stage 2. Upgrade - Stage 2 . Migrate the databases due to a large number of application upgrades. To do this, run the following: . helm upgrade cluedin-platform -n cluedin cluedin/cluedin-platform \\ --version 2.0.0 \\ --values ${ExportedOriginalValues} \\ --values platform-custom-values.yaml \\ --values platform-upgrade-v2-stage2.yaml \\ --wait \\ --timeout 20m0s . This will trigger a neo4j database backup and migration along with a SQL upgrade. It can take up to 20 minutes to complete. It’ll be ready when all init-jobs have completed and the core pods are all in a running state. Please note because of the previous step scale down, only a few pods will be brought up during this stage. When successfully done, it’s ready for the final stage. Upgrade - Stage 3 . Assuming the above has been successful, it’s time to actually bring the environment back up into a running and usable state. To do this, run the final helm command below: . helm upgrade cluedin-platform -n cluedin cluedin/cluedin-platform \\ --version 2.0.0 \\ --values ${ExportedOriginalValues} \\ --values platform-custom-values.yaml \\ --set 'application.system.runDatabaseJobsOnUpgrade=true' \\ --set 'application.system.runNugetFullRestore=true' \\ --wait \\ --timeout 20m0s . After approximately 10-15 minutes, your environment should be 100% completed, and you should be able to access the front end of the UI. ",

    "title": "Common Reasons Rules Run Slowly",
    "content": "1. Large Data Volumes . | Symptom: Rules that work quickly on small datasets suddenly take much longer on production-scale data. | Explanation: Each Rule must scan through entities to find matches. Processing millions of records inevitably takes more time. | . Tip: Test Rules on smaller sample datasets before applying them to production. 2. Complex Rule Conditions . | Symptom: Rules with multiple conditions, regex patterns, or nested logic perform slower. | Explanation: Each additional condition increases the number of evaluations per record. Regex-based conditions are especially costly. | . Tip: Simplify Rule logic where possible. Split complex Rules into multiple smaller, focused Rules. 3. High Number of Active Rules . | Symptom: Processing slows down as more Rules are added. | Explanation: CluedIn must evaluate every active Rule against incoming records. Even if most Rules don’t apply, they still need to be checked. | . Tip: Review your Rule library and disable Rules that are not actively needed. 4. Data Distribution &amp; Entity Linking . | Symptom: Rules that depend on entity relationships (e.g., linked customers, orders, or products) take longer. | Explanation: Linking requires lookups across multiple entities. Large or poorly matched datasets increase lookup overhead. | . Tip: Ensure entity matching configurations are optimized before running Rules that depend on them. 5. Environment &amp; Resource Constraints . | Symptom: Rules slow down during periods of heavy ingestion or other intensive processing. | Explanation: The Rule engine shares compute resources with ingestion, matching, and enrichment jobs. Resource contention can delay execution. | . Tip: Schedule large Rule runs during off-peak hours or scale your CluedIn deployment to handle higher throughput. 6. Reprocessing vs. Incremental Runs . | Symptom: A Rule re-run on all historical data takes significantly longer than on new incremental data. | Explanation: Full reprocessing forces CluedIn to re-check all records, while incremental runs only apply to newly ingested or updated data. | . Tip: Use incremental runs where possible. Reserve full re-runs for cases where underlying Rule logic has changed. ",

    "content": "1. Prioritize Deterministic Matching Rules . It’s tempting to design complex rules to cover every possible variation in your data. However, this often increases false positives and makes matching less predictable. | Instead of chasing perfection, create rules that are as deterministic and strict as possible (e.g., “Exact match on Tax ID” or “Exact match on Email Address”). | Use high-confidence identifiers first: IDs, email, phone numbers, domains. | Apply fuzzy matching sparingly, only where no strong identifier exists. | . 2. Use CluedIn Clean to Improve Input Data . Matching accuracy is only as good as the quality of your input data. Use CluedIn Clean to standardize and normalize data before running matching: . | Clean addresses into a structured, comparable format. | Convert phone numbers to E.164 international format. | Normalize company names (remove “Ltd”, “Inc”, punctuation). | Standardize casing, diacritics, and whitespace. | . By cleaning first, you make it easier for deterministic rules to succeed, rather than relying on fuzzy matching to compensate for poor data quality. 3. Apply Normalisers to Ignore Irrelevant Differences . Normalisers allow you to exclude certain aspects of data from the matching process so that records aren’t incorrectly treated as different: . | Case Normalisation: Treat CLUEdin, CluedIn, and cluedin as identical. | Whitespace Normalisation: Ignore leading/trailing or multiple spaces. | Punctuation Normalisation: Strip characters like commas, periods, or dashes where not significant. | Custom Normalisers: Define rules to remove common “noise” (e.g., Ltd, Inc, GmbH). | .

    "content": "Wiz Research recently disclosed a series of critical unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities affecting the Ingress NGINX Controller in Kubernetes (CVE-2025-1097, CVE-2025-1098, CVE-2025-24514, and CVE-2025-1974), collectively known as IngressNightmare. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain unauthorized access to Kubernetes secrets across namespaces. More information can be found in: . | Infosecurity Magazine . | The Hacker News . | . CluedIn is not impacted by these vulnerabilities, as we do not use NGINX as our ingress controller. Instead, CluedIn relies on HAProxy, which is not affected by these issues. If you have deployed CluedIn using the standard setup, you are not impacted. However, customers who have modified their Ingress setup outside of CluedIn’s recommended configuration should review their infrastructure and apply any necessary security updates. Our security team continuously monitors emerging threats and ensures that CluedIn remains secure. For any questions or further assistance, contact CluedIn support team at support@cluedin.com. ",
