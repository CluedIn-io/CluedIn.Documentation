				<h1 id="what-is-the-different-between-cluedin-and-other-data-integration-platforms">What is the different between CluedIn and other data integration platforms?</h1>

<p>Whether you are using SAP Data Services, Azure Data Factory, SSIS, Talend, Python, SAS Institute, Informatica Powercenter or other ETL based tools, they all hold something in common - they require you as the engineer, architecture or business user to map different systems together. At CluedIn, we have found that the process of finding out what Id’s need to be connected between systems as to unify or connect the records is actually the hardest part of the entire process - in fact, it gets to a point where it is just impossible to do.</p>

<p>CluedIn uses a schema-less based integration pattern that doesn’t require a developer, architect or business user to instruct our platform of how different systems connect together - rather, we ask for a much more simpler and streamlined mapping and CluedIn will do all the work to find the relationships between the systems. In fact, we will often find connections that you could never find yourself.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-with-the-data-ingested-that-is-bad-quality-has-non-allowed-values-or-is-noise-or-mess">What happens with the data ingested that is bad quality, has non-allowed values or is noise or mess?</h1>

<p>CluedIn is an ELT type of integration platform where we want to take the data in as it is. No transforms. No cleaning. Nothing. That is our job! Bad quality data will happen all the time and hence this is one of the big reasons why enterprise companies are taking so long to get access to ready-to-use data. There are so many places in CluedIn that will catch and distribute the work involved in fixing and addressing the data quality issues that stream through the CluedIn processing engine. Firstly, it starts with CluedIn having many prebuilt processing steps to automatically clean and normalise data into the highest fidelity format.  Secondly, you have your ability to build up lists of “black-listed” values and to either remove them or automatically transform them into another value on processing. Finally, you can setup rules that dictate good versus bad values. This means that data keeps flowing for data that meets the standards - everything else will be put into a quarantine section for you to resolve so that less and less data has issues.</p>

<h1 id="what-do-you-do-about-sensitive-and-personal-data">What do you do about sensitive and personal data?</h1>

<p>CluedIn will natively detect personal data and will start by simply letting you know where it is. Depedent upon your requirements, we then allow simple actions to either mask, anonymise or remove the data. As for sensitive data, this is often open to interpretation. What is sensitive for you might not be for another business and hence CluedIn allows you to flag records as sensitive. This will build up a data model specifically for your account that will be trained to look for records with similar traits and flag them automatically over time.</p>

<h1 id="if-cluedin-has-4-different-databases-all-storing-my-raw-data---isnt-that-going-to-be-a-lot-of-storage">If CluedIn has 4 different databases, all storing my raw data - isn’t that going to be a lot of storage?</h1>

<p>The first thing to answer here is, that you have full control over what data you ingest into CluedIn. There are many cases where you will not want to bring in all the data. For the data that we do ingest, it is also worth mentioning that for certain types of data, we are not taking a full copy of the data but rather extracting what we need e.g. files only extract content and metadata. CluedIn also compresses all the data that is stored in the databases, meaning that often the storgage size is much smaller than the original source data itself. To put this in perspective, we have customers that have processed 100’s of TB’s of raw data, but in CluedIn the databases will collectively be approximately 2 to 3 TB’s.</p>

<h1 id="once-the-data-is-in-cluedin-how-do-i-get-it-out">Once the data is in CluedIn, how do I get it out?</h1>

<p>CluedIn is designed to sit in-between source and target systems and hence it is in our interest to make it extremely easy to get the data out of us. There are two main ways that we recommend this, but ask that in production, you don’t use the CSV or File options - after all, this is typically the cause for siloed data in the first place! Firstly, our GraphQL API allows you to search through all the data in your CluedIn account and will return the results in JSON format. You can choose what properties you would like to select or project from the query as to limit the data to only what you need. This is useful for when you have other systems that want to “pull” data from CluedIn. Quite honestly, you won’t find a lot of systems that support making GraphQL queries or REST queries and hence we offer another option that we think is more suitable. Secondly, we allow you to create streams of data directly out of CluedIn (Push) to a target. This target could be a SQL database, an Apache Spark stream, direct to Power BI or to the dimension tables of your Data Warehouse.</p>

<h1 id="considering-that-cluedin-uses-databases-that-are-ots-off-the-shelf-can-i-access-data-directly-from-there">Considering that CluedIn uses databases that are OTS (Off the shelf), can I access data directly from there?</h1>

<p>We are not going to stop you doing this, but do recommend that you only do this in a developer environment. If you are wanting to talk directly to the databases, CluedIn has built you GraphQL interfaces to be able to do this in a way that guarantees that you have isolated access to only the data from your own account. CluedIn ships with tools to administrate the different datastores and hence we obvioulsy are influencing you to be able to look in these datastores as a developer. The recommendation is to turn off native access to these datastores when you deploy into your production environment - in fact, by default our Kubernetes setup has it disabled by default.</p>

<h1 id="when-cluedin-says-it-has-prebuilt-integrations-what-about-when-we-have-customised-our-system-so-much">When CluedIn says it has prebuilt integrations, what about when we have customised our system so much?</h1>

<p>The majority of integrations that CluedIn has are working with the assumption that you can change the underlying model of the source system. Hence the majority of our integration will still require you to map the source objects into CluedIn to get the best out of your data. The integrations handle all the connection, delivery and scheduling, paging and sourcing of data. You as a Data Architect will need to map this into the Clue object. Fortunately, our data integration pattern makes this a simple task and unlike other data integration platforms, we don’t need you to tell us how everything wires together - that’s our job!</p>

<h1 id="if-cluedin-is-connecting-the-data-for-us-wont-that-end-up-in-a-data-model-that-is-a-mess">If CluedIn is connecting the data for us, won’t that end up in a data model that is a mess?</h1>

<p>Yes! Because guess what? Your data landscape is typically a mess! The goal of CluedIn is not to form the perfect model of your data for a paritcular use case - it is to find how the data is naturally connected and then allow you to project your perfect model for ANY use case you can think of. You will find that the model that we build (we use the Graph for this part) will match the model that your data finds is the way to find links between your different systems. Using the same model, we give intuitive and simple-to-use tools to mutate this natural model to a more rigid model for the use cases that you want in that particular model. The good news is that the Graph was designed for running these types of projects - in fact, they are as fast as an index lookup. This means that projecting a “dirty” model into a clean one is something that scales and performs really well.</p>

<h1 id="the-admin-screen-of-cluedin-is-great-but-i-want-to-automate-things-how-do-i-do-this">The Admin screen of CluedIn is great, but I want to automate things! How do I do this?</h1>

<p>The good news is that the native CluedIn administration screen is built ontop of the same REST API that you have direct access to as well. This means that you can do everything in the REST API that you can do in the user interface (and more!). This also means that you can script anything in CluedIn via our REST API, PowerShell or other scripting languages.</p>

<h1 id="i-have-made-a-change-in-cluedin-that-requires-me-to-re-process-all-the-data-what-do-i-do">I have made a change in CluedIn that requires me to re-process all the data, what do I do?</h1>

<p>This will happen many times with your CluedIn account! In fact, it is extremely normal and expected. CluedIn has been designed with the idea in mind that we will re-process the data all the time. Once you have made your change, you have quite a lot of control over the level of re-processing. You can re-process at a source level, globally, at a record level or even something a little more custom e.g. entity type level.</p>

<h1 id="does-cluedin-index-everything">Does CluedIn index everything?</h1>

<p>Yes. Yes we do. You can however influence the CluedIn engine to store data in a more optimum way. When you are setting up your Vocabularies, you have the chance to set a Vocabulary Type. This will influence how indexes are built and we would strongly recommend doing this. Even if you do not do this, all your content will be search-able, but you can always make things faster and more efficient if you setup your Vocabularies properly.</p>

<h1 id="with-4-databases-how-does-cluedin-guarantee-transactions">With 4 databases, how does CluedIn guarantee transactions?</h1>

<p>CluedIn ingests data into an enterprise service bus. This helps us guarantee delivery of data. CluedIn utilises “Eventual Consistency” for the different data stores. This means that CluedIn takes all records off the bus into a transactional log. The different databases will then read off the transaction log as fast as they can. This gurantees transactional support on your data, but “eventual consistency” in the different data stores. With this setup and the fact that the different datastores will consume off the log in batches, it lessens the likelihood that the database will have issues with having a 100% consistency across the datasores at the same time.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-if-i-ingest-records-that-dont-have-any-ids-that-overlap">What happens if I ingest records that don’t have any Id’s that overlap?</h1>

<p>This happens all the time! In fact, it is the reason why systems like CluedIn exist. Firstly, although it might seem like there won’t be overlap, often there is. You might find with your traditional approaches that tracking down the columns that match from system to system don’t make it easy to find the links - but the eventual connectivity pattern of CluedIn will do all that work for you. For times when you definitely don’t have Id overlaps, there are many fallbacks that yield good results. Firstly, you can use the out of the box integrations to external data sources (or build new providers) that may have the Id’s that you need to link systems. Secondly, you have the CluedIn Fuzzy matching engine which can use non-identifying properties to find possible and statistically confident matches in duplicates or in linkages.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-cluedin-written-in-c-isnt-that-slow">Why is CluedIn written in C#, isn’t that slow?</h1>

<p>The team behind CluedIn purposefully chose .net core and C# as the language for our processing engine for many reasons.</p>

<p>1: Our core development team has decades of combined experience in building large, scalable and performant .net applications. 
2: The .net environment has jumped leaps and bounds and has continued support for Microsoft and the community. The fact that it is open-source helped in the decision as well. 
3: .net is designed to write very large applications and scale in maintaining, seperation of concern and ease of deployment. 
4: .net and C# is very much, not slow. In fact, compared to the majority of popular languages today it is very fast. Some could argue that it is not as memory-efficient, but we think that the trade-offs to deliver solutions to you faster is well worth it.</p>

<h1 id="i-am-not-a-c-developer-does-that-mean-i-cant-extend-cluedin">I am not a C# developer, does that mean I can’t extend CluedIn?</h1>

<p>The interfaces to communicate with CluedIn are actually HTTP i.e. REST. Our C# layer essentially wraps this and talks REST. This means that you can actually use any language that you want to talk to CluedIn, however there are some restrictions or limitations if you do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot inject custom logic into the same application domain as CluedIn.</li>
  <li>You will have to host your custom code in another host that is not CluedIn.</li>
  <li>You cannot currently use the crawler templates that are available only in C#.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s go with some examples for you. What if you are a Python, R, SQL or GO developer? Let’s say you are wanting to build a custom integration that can be added through the user-interface but the code itself is written in Python.</p>

<h1 id="what-type-of-data-is-cluedin-not-suited-for">What type of data is CluedIn not suited for?</h1>

<p>There are many use-cases where CluedIn could be considered overkill or not fit for purpose. There are many use-cases that do not need all of the data preperation and cleaning pieces of CluedIn. It could very much be argued that IOT data doesn’t suffer from the same problems or require the same data preperation than other data such as operation business data. Hence here is a list of use-cases or data that we don’t think is necessarily suitable for CluedIn:</p>

<p>1: Processing Signal/IOT data that doesn’t have data quality issues or doesn’t need cataloging, governance - but rather needs to be made available in a Dashboard as fast as humanly possible. 
2: If you have a limited amount of systems to integrate and there is no problems with determining how the records are conneceted between the different systems. A good example would be if you just wanted to intergate your Dropbox account with your CRM. 
3: Where you do not want to move data. CluedIn copies data from sources to target. It won’t necessarily take all the data, but it is an ingestion engine. You have to be very careful with this use-case as many problems cannot be properly solved without taking copies of the data.</p>
